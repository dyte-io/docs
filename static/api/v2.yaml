    ## Rate Limiting

    Rate limits specify the maximum number of requests (GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE) a user can make in a given time period. When you exceed a rate limit, the API request fails and returns the HTTP 429 status code. The HTTP 429 status code indicates that the user made too many requests in a given period of time ("rate limiting").

    We apply rate limits at the IP address level.

    ### Rate Limit by IP Address

    The rate limit threshold is set at 2000 calls per minute per IP address. After 2000 calls, a 429 status code is sent, and access to any of our APIs is denied. 

    Note: Rate limit is applied at the domain level, which means that all APIs are included in the threshold.

    | Number of Requests | Resources | Time Window | Status Code Returned when Threshold Exceeds |
    |--|--|--|--|
    | 2000 | Per IP | Per minute | HTTP 429 |

    ### Sample

    The following sample shows the API response for the status code 429.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
    retry-after: 4
    x-envoy-ratelimited: true
    date: Tue, 06 Sep 2022 08:32:55 GMT
    server: envoy
    ```

    ### Why Do You Set a Rate Limit?

    Rate limiting is required to prevent the network from becoming overloaded as a result of numerous requests. This could be due to hacking activity, overuse of the Dyte APIs by a bot, or a bug in the code. Setting a rate limit helps to prevent this type of API overuse.

    Setting a rate limit also protects us from various types of attacks, such as:
    - [Brute Force Attack](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/brute-force-attack)
    - [DDOS attack](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/ddos-attack-protection/)
    - [Web-scraping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-web-scraping-and-how-to-use-it/)
