# Sending a chat message

As mentioned in [introduction](./introduction), there are 3 types of chat
messages - `text`, `images`, and `file`. There are methods in `DyteChat` to send
a message of each type.

## Send a text message

To send a text message, the `dyteClient.chat.sendTextMessage()` method can be
used. It take a string `message` as an argument and sends it to the room.

```dart
final message = "Is this the real life?";
dyteClient.chat.sendTextMessage(message);
```

## Send an image

You can send an image with the help of `dyteClient.chat.sendImageMessage()` and
sends it to the participants in the meeting.

```dart
final filePath = "file_path_of_image";
final fileName = "file_name";
dyteClient.chat.sendImageMessage(filePath, fileName);
```

## Send a file

Sending a file is quite similar to sending an image. The only difference is that
when you send an image, a preview will be shown in the meeting chat, which is
not the case for sending files. That being said, an image can be sent as a file
too using `dyteClient.chat.sendFileMessage()`.

```dart
final filePath = "file_path_of_image";
final fileName = "file_name";
dyteClient.chat.sendFileMessage(filePath, fileName);
```
