# Creating a poll

A new poll can be created using the `create` method from the [`meeting.polls`](./introduction) object. The `meeting.polls.create()` method accepts the following params.

| Param     | Type     | Default Value | Required | Description                                                |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| question  | string   |       -       | yes      | The question that is to be voted for.                      |
| options   | string[] |       -       | yes      | The options of the poll.                                   |
| anonymous | boolean  |       -       | yes      | If true, the poll votes are anonymous.                     |
| hideVotes | boolean  |       -       | yes      | If true, the votes on the poll are hidden.                 |

The following snippet creates a poll where votes are anonymous.

```dart
meeting.poll.create(
    question: "Are you an early bird or a night owl?",
    options: ["Early bird", "Night owl"],
    anonymous: true,
    hideVotes: false,
);
```
