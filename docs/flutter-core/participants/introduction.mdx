# Introduction - Participants

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. 
For example, to get all the participants who joined the meeting:

```dart
// get all joined participants
final joinedParticipants = meeting.participants.joined;
```

The `meeting.participants` object has the following properties.

- `joined`: A list that contains all the participants who have joined the meeting.
- `waitlisted`: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the meeting.
- `active`: A list that contains all the participants except the local user who are supposed to be on the screen at the moment 
- `pinned`: A list that contains all the pinned participants of the meeting.
- `screenshares`: A list that contains all the participants who have shared screen in the meeting.

Therefore, if you were to make a grid of participants, you'd use the `active` list, but to display all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined` list.

Each participant in each of the `joined`, `waitlisted`, `active`, `pinned` and `screenshares` list is of type `DyteMeetingParticipant`.

You can subscribe to various events on the participants by implementing `DyteParticipantEventsListener` and passing the object to `meeting.addParticipantEventsListener(dyteParticipantEventsListener)`.

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo` or `disableVideo`

```dart

void onVideoUpdate(bool videoEnabled) {
  if (videoEnabled) {
      // video is enabled, and other participants in room can see local user
    } else {
      // video is disabled, and other participants in room can not see local user.
    }
}

```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio` or `disableAudio`

```dart

void audioUpdate({
  required bool audioEnabled,
  required DyteMeetingParticipant participant,
}) {
    if (audioEnabled) {
      // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
    } else {
      // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
    }
}

```
