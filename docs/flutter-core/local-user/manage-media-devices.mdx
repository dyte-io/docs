# Manage Media Devices

Media devices represents the hardwar for the camera, microphone and speaker devices.
To get the list of media devices that are currently being used, you can use the following methods:

```dart
// Get all audio devices
final audioDevices = await meeting.localUser.getAudioDevices();

// Get all video devices
final videoDevices = await meeting.localUser.getVideoDevices();
```

## Set device

To set a device as an active device, you can call `setDevice` method. This takes a `MediaDeviceInfo` object, and replaces the same `kind` device. 

```dart
await meeting.localUser.setDevice(device);
```
