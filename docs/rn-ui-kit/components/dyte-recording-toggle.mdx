# DyteRecordingToggle

A button which toggles recording state of a meeting.

Only a privileged user can perform this action, thus the button will not be
visible for participants who don't have the permission to record a meeting.

Note that the toggle button won't be rendered if you do not have the necessary
permission.

```jsx
<View>
  <DyteRecordingToggle size="sm" meeting={meeting} />
  <DyteRecordingToggle size="lg" meeting={meeting} />
  <DyteRecordingToggle variant="horizontal" size="sm" meeting={meeting} />
</View>
```
