# DyteMeeting

A single component which renders an entire meeting UI.

It loads your preset and renders the UI based on it. With this component, you
don't have to handle all the states, dialogs and other smaller bits of managing
the application.

```jsx
<DyteMeeting mode="fill" meeting={meeting} style={{ height: '480px' }} />
```
