# Introduction

Dyte's React Native UI Kit is a prebuilt design library of UI components that makes it
easy to integrate video and voice calls into any app or website within minutes.

## The Anatomy of React Native UI Kit

The UI Kit is a design library of prebuilt UI components built on top of the
core SDKs. Core SDK handles all the low-level media and network handling parts
of a meeting and exposes simpler APIs to use. You can create a meeting object
using the web-core components and pass it to the UI Kit components.

- Uses a layered design structure, allowing you to start with one prebuilt
  component and slowly add further layers as the needs evolve.
- Includes a number of [Hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react). Hooks
  enable you to use various React features from your components. For more
  information, see [Use React Native Core Hooks](/react-native/using-hooks).

## How to Use React Native UI Kit?

Dyte's UI Kit offers a couple of ways to get started with your live video and
voice calling applications.

- **Use prebuilt components**: You can use prebuilt `DyteMeeting` component to
  create your meeting quickly. With this component, you don't have to handle all
  the states, dialogs, and other aspects of managing the application. The UI kit
  also respect your permissions and theming configuration from the preset.

  For more information, see [React Native UI Kit Quickstart](/react-native/quickstart).

- **Build your own UI**: Dyte also offers the flexibility to build your own UI
  using various individual components. This offers limitless customization
  options, ranging from colors and font to spacing, participant tiles, screen
  share views, logo, height, width and more, you can tailor the UI to fit your
  exact needs. See Build your own UI section.

## Supported Devices

Here are the device requirements:

- Android API Level 24 and above
- iOS 12 and above

## Features

- Dyte UI Kit is built using
  [React Native components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis). React Native Components are a built-in components that enables you to develop reusable custom elements without relying on any third-party frameworks.
- Dyte's React Native UI Kit also provides multiple
  [Hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react). Hooks let you use different
  React features from your components. This provides seamless developer
  experience when integrating Dyte's UI Kit in your React project. You can
  simply import the package from `@dytesdk/react-native-core`, which is a hooks
  wrapper on `@dytesdk/react-native-core`. For more information, see
  [Use React Native Core Hooks](/react-native/using-hooks).
- Each component uses design tokens in conjunction with CSS variables for
  styling. This makes the customization super simple and easy. Other than the
  design tokens, we've also attempted to improve the customization options, with
  features like Internationalisation (i18n) and Icon Packs Support.
