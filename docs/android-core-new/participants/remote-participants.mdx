# Participant Maps

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under
`meeting.participants`. These **does not** include the local user. Use the
methods and events to consume the participants data. For example, to get all the
participants who joined the meeting:

```ts
// get all joined participants
const joinedParticipants = meeting.participants.joined;
```

The `meeting.participants` object has the following **maps** of participants

- **joined**: A map that contains all the participants who are currently in the meeting
  except the local user
- **waitlisted**: A map that contains all the participants waiting to join the
  meeting.
- **active**: A map that contains all the participants except the local user whose media is subscribed to i.e
  participants are supposed to be on the screen at the moment except the local user
- **pinned**: A map that contains all the pinned participants of the meeting.

Therefore if you were to make a video / audio grid of participants, you'd use the `active`
map, but to display the list of all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined` map.

Each participant in each of the `joined`, `waitlisted`, `active`, and `pinned`
maps is of type [`DyteParticipant`](../reference/DyteParticipant.md). Read more
about each individual `participant` object
[here](../participants/participant-object.mdx).

Each of these maps are of type
[`DyteParticipantMap`](../reference/DyteParticipantMap.md), and therefore emit a
`participantJoined` event when a participant is added to the map, and a
`participantLeft` event when a participant leaves the map. For instance, to
listen for when a participant gets pinned in the meeting, you can use the
following snippet:

```ts
meeting.participants.pinned.on('participantJoined', (participant) => {
  console.log(`Participant ${participant.name} got pinned`);
});
```

and these other properties

- `count`: The number of participants who are joined in the meeting.
- `pageCount`: Number of pages available in paginated mode.
- `maxActiveParticipantsCount`: The maximum number of participants that can be
  present in the active state.
- `lastActiveSpeaker `: This stores the `participantId` of the last participant
  who spoke in the meeting.

## Set participant view mode

The view mode indicates whether the participants are populated in `ACTIVE_GRID`
mode or `PAGINATED` mode. In `ACTIVE_GRID` mode, the participants are
automatically replaced in `meeting.participants.active`, based on who is
speaking or who has their video turned on.

In `PAGINATED` mode, the participants in `meeting.participants.active` will be
fixed. Only when you call the `meeting.participants.setPage(pageNumber)` method,
it will replace the `active` participants with a different set of participants.

You can change the participant view between `ACTIVE_GRID` and `PAGINATED` mode
using the following method. This will trigger `viewModeChanged` event as a side
affect.

```ts
// set the view mode to paginated
await meeting.participants.setViewMode('PAGINATED');

// set the view mode to active grid
await meeting.participants.setViewMode('ACTIVE_GRID');
```

### Set page number in paginated mode

The `setPage()` method allows you to switch between pages of participants
present in the meeting.

```ts
// switch to second page
await meeting.participants.setPage(2);
```

## Waiting room methods

The `acceptWaitingRoomRequest()` method accepts requests from waitlisted
participants if user has appropriate permissions.

```ts
await meeting.participants.joined.acceptWaitingRoomRequest(participantId);
```

The `rejectWaitingRoomRequest()` method requests from waitlisted participants if
user has appropriate permissions.

```ts
await meeting.participants.joined.rejectWaitingRoomRequest(participantId);
```
