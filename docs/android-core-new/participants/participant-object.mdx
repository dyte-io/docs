# The participant object

The `participant` object consists of all the information related to a particular participant. For instance, it contains a participants video/audio/screenshare stream, and the participant's name. It also contains state variables that indicate whether a participant's camera is on or off, and whether they are muted or unmuted.

The participant object has the following properties.

- `id`: The `participantId` of the participant (aka `peerId`).
- `userId`: The `userId` of the participant.
- `name`: The participant's name.
- `picture`: The participant's picture (if any).
- `clientSpecificId`: An arbitrary ID that can be set to identify the
  participant.
- `videoTrack`: The video track of the participant.
- `screenShareTrack`: The video and audio (if any) track of the participant's
  screen share stream.
- `videoEnabled`: Set to true if the participant's camera is on.
- `audioEnabled`: Set to true if the participant is unmuted.
- `isPinned`: True if current user is pinned in the meeting room.
- `presetName`: Name of the preset associated with the participant.
- `stageStatus`: Status of stage for the participant

## To get video view of a given participant

You can call `participant.getVideoView()` which will return a View which further
can used to add in any ViewGroup in android.

Similarly one can use `participant.getScreenShareView()` which will return a
View which further can used to add in any ViewGroup in android.

## Host Controls

If you are the host of the room, you will see the **host controls** when you click the **three-dot menu** on the top right corner of the participants list. The host controls allow you to manage the participants in the room.

The host controls include the following options:

- **Mute/Unmute**: Mute or unmute a participant.
- **Kick**: Kick a participant from the room.
- **Pin**: Pin a participant's video.
- **Turn off video**: Turn off a participant's video.

You can also use these methods from our participant object to
perform these actions programmatically.

```kotlin
val participant = meeting.participants.joined.firstOrNull { it.id == participantId }

participant?.let { pcpt ->
  // To disable a participant's video stream
  pcpt.disableVideo();

  // To disable a participant's audio stream
  pcpt.disableAudio();

  // To kick a participant from the meeting
  pcpt.kick();
}
```

You can also `pin` or `unpin` a participant in the meeting. All "pinned"
participants are added to the `meeting.participants.pinned` map.

```kotlin
val participant = meeting.participants.joined.firstOrNull { it.id == participantId }

participant?.let { pcpt ->
  // To pin a participant
  pcpt.pin();

  // To unpin a participant
  pcpt.unpin();
}
```
