# Recording

The `meeting.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a
meeting. You can also get the current status of a recording using this API.

The `meeting.recording` object has the following properties:

## List recordings

Retrieve a list of active recordings along with their current status.

```ts
const recordings = meeting.recording.recordings;
```

it returns list of recording ids and their state

```ts
[
  {
    id: '<recording-id>',
    state: '<recording-state>',
  },
];
```

The recording states include `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, `PAUSED`, and `STOPPING`.

## Start a recording

Initiate a recording using the start method.

```ts
await meeting.recording.start();
```

To enable multiple parallel recordings, the first recording must be started with the option `{ allowMultiple: true }`.

```ts
await meeting.recording.start({ allowMultiple: true });
```

Subsequent recordings can then be initiated while the first is still running.

## Stop a recording

End an active recording with the stop method.

```ts
await meeting.recording.stop();
```

To stop a specific recording, provide the recording ID:

```ts
await meeting.recording.stop(recordingId);
```

Omitting the recording ID will stop all recordings in `RECORDING` or `PAUSED` state.

## Pause a recording

Temporarily halt a recording using the pause method.

```ts
await meeting.recording.pause();
```

To pause a specific recording, include the recording ID:

```ts
await meeting.recording.pause(recordingId);
```

Without a recording ID, all recordings in the `RECORDING` state will be paused.

## Resume a recording

Restart a paused recording with the resume method.

```ts
await meeting.recording.resume();
```

For resuming a specific recording, pass the recording ID:

```ts
await meeting.recording.resume(recordingId);
```

If no recording ID is specified, all recordings in the `PAUSED` state will be resumed.

## Recording Configuration

You can set the defaults for recording during initialization

```js
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  authToken,
  defaults: {
    recording: recordingConfig,
  },
});
```

In recording config you can specify height, width and codec of the recording output. You can also customize the recording file name prefix.

```ts
interface RecordingConfig {
  videoConfig?: {
    height?: number;
    width?: number;
    codec?: 'H264' | 'VP8';
  };
  fileNamePrefix?: string;
}
```

#### videoConfig

1. **codec** - Codec using which the recording will be encoded. `H264` will use a `mp4` container, `VP8` will use a `webm` container

   Allowed values: `H264` | `VP8`

   Default: `H264`

2. **width** - Width of the recording video in pixels
   Allowed values: 1 \>= width \<= 1920

   Default: `1280`

3. **height** - Height of the recording video in pixels
   Allowed values: 1 \>= height \<= 1920

   Default: `720`

#### fileNamePrefix

You can customize the file name generated by Dyte recorder. All recordings for the meeting will start with the prefix provided here.
It is equivalent of `file_name_prefix` in our [start recording API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/)

## Check active recording state

The `meeting.recording.recordingState` property describes the current state of
the recording. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, `PAUSED` and
`STOPPING`.
