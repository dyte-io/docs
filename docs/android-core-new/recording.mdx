# Recording

The `meeting.recording` object in Dyte's Android Core SDK provides APIs to manage recording within a meeting.

### Recording State

The `meeting.recording.recordingState` property indicates the current state of the recording. Possible states include `IDLE`, 
`STARTING`, `RECORDING`, `PAUSED`, and `STOPPING`.

### Starting a Recording

To start a recording, use the `start()` method of the `meeting.recording` object.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.start()
```

### Stopping a Recording

To stop an active recording, use the `stop()` method.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.stop()
```

### Pausing a Recording

To temporarily pause a recording, use the `pause()` method.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.pause()
```

### Resuming a Recording

To resume a paused recording, use the `resume()` method.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.resume()
```

### Listening for Recording Events

To handle recording-related events, implement the `DyteRecordingEventsListener` interface. This interface provides callbacks for 
various recording events:

- `onMeetingRecordingStarted()`: Called when the recording is started or resumed, either by the user or their peer.
- `onMeetingRecordingEnded()`: Called when the recording is stopped or paused, either by the user or their peer.
- `onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(state: DyteRecordingState)`: Notifies when there is a change in the recording state.
- `onMeetingRecordingStopError(e: Exception)`: Indicates an error occurred while stopping an active recording.
- `onMeetingRecordingPauseError(e: Exception)`: Indicates an error occurred while pausing an active recording.
- `onMeetingRecordingResumeError(e: Exception)`: Indicates an error occurred while resuming a paused recording.

```kotlin
meeting.addRecordingEventsListener(object : DyteRecordingEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRecordingStarted() {
        // Handle recording started
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingEnded() {
        // Handle recording stopped
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(state: DyteRecordingState) {
        // Handle recording state update
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingStopError(e: Exception) {
        // Handle recording stop error
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingPauseError(e: Exception) {
        // Handle recording pause error
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingResumeError(e: Exception) {
        // Handle recording resume error
    }
})
```

Implement these callbacks to handle recording events and errors appropriately in your application.
