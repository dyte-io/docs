# Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to use Dyte's core SDKs to add live video and audio to
your JavaScript based applications.

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- Install the Dyte SDK
- Initialize Dyte Client
- Connect to the meeting
- Go live!

## Before Getting Started

- Make sure you've read the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic
  and completed the following steps:

  - Create a [Dyte Developer Account](https://dev.dyte.io/)
  - Create a [Dyte Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
  - [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) to the meeting

## Step 1: Install the SDK

You can install the package using CDN, npm or Yarn.

<Tabs
  groupId="node-pm"
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: "npm", value: "npm" },
    { label: "yarn", value: "yarn" },
    { label: "CDN", value: "CDN" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="npm">
Install the SDK using npm.

```shell
npm install @dytesdk/web-core
```

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fweb-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fweb-core)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn">
Install the SDK using yarn.

```shell
yarn add @dytesdk/web-core
```

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fweb-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@dytesdk%2Fweb-core)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="CDN">
Add the following script tag in the head of your HTML file.
  
  <WebCoreCDNInstallation />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

1. Initialize the Dyte client.
2. Call the `init()` method and pass the authToken.

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken` | After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant). The API response contains the authToken. |

```js
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  authToken,
});
```

## Step 3: Connect to the meeting

Now, you have established the connection with the Dyte meeting server
successfully. Next step is to join the room.

### Join the room

To join the meeting room, call join() method on the DyteClient instance as
shown below.

```js
await meeting.join();
```

:::info

Once the join room process completes roomJoined event is emitted on meeting.self
namespace.

If you want to perform any actions, such as enabling audio, video, or starting
and stopping recording, you can do so after the roomJoined event is fired.

For example:

```js
meeting.self.on('roomJoined', () => {
  console.log('User has joined the room', meeting.self.roomJoined);
  // run my actions.
});

await meeting.join();
```

:::

### Leave the room

Once the meeting is over, you can leave the meeting room.

To leave the meeting room, call `leaveRoom()` method on the dyteClient as shown
below.

```js
await meeting.leaveRoom();
```
