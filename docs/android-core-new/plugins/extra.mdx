## Subscribe to events from a plugin

A plugin emits the following events:

- `enabled` - Emitted when a plugin is enabled.
- `closed` - Emitted when a plugin is closed.
- `dyteStateUpdate` - Emitted when the state of the plugin has changed.
- `ready` - Emitted when the plugin is ready to exchange data with client SDK.
- `toggleViewMode` - Emitted when the control is toggled for users with
  view-only permissions for a plugin.

```ts
const pluginId = '...';
const plugin = meeting.plugins.active.get(pluginId);
plugin.on('enabled', () => {
  console.log('The plugin has been enabled');
});
```

## Send data to the plugin

You can send data (type `any`) to a plugin using the `sendData()` method. This
method comes in handy when building your own plugin.

```ts
const pluginId = '...';
const plugin = meeting.plugins.active.get(pluginId);
plugin.on('ready', () => {
  plugin.sendData({
    eventName: 'my-custom-event',
    data: 'Hello world',
  });
});
```
