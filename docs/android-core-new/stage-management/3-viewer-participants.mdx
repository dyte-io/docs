Viewer participants in a stage-enabled meeting are users whose preset permission for media production is set as `CAN_REQUEST`. 
The `meeting.stage` object provides APIs for viewer participants to request stage access and withdraw their join stage request.

### Request Access

To request access to the stage, you can call the `requestAccess()` method:

```kotlin
meeting.stage.requestAccess()
```

When a host accepts the user's stage access request or allows the user directly to the stage, the SDK triggers the 
`onPresentRequestReceived` callback in `DyteStageEventListener`. You can listen to this event:

```kotlin
meeting.addStageEventsListener(object : DyteStageEventListener {
    override fun onPresentRequestReceived() {
        // Host accepted the join stage request or invited user directly to stage
    }
})
```

You can then call the `join()` method to finally join the stage.

**Note**: If the host has directly allowed the user to join the stage and they want to decline, you should use the `leave()` method.

### Cancel Access Request

To cancel or withdraw a pending stage access request, you can call the `cancelRequestAccess()` method:

```kotlin
meeting.stage.cancelRequestAccess()
```
