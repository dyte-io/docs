In a stage management-enabled meeting, a user with the `selfPermissions.host.canAcceptStageRequests` permission as `true` is 
considered a host. The `meeting.stage` object in Dyte's Android Core SDK provides stage management APIs that allow hosts to 
manage stage access requests, invite participants to the stage, and remove participants from the stage.

### List of Stage Access Requests

You can retrieve the list of pending stage access requests by accessing the `meeting.stage.accessRequests` property. This property 
provides a list of `DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant` objects who have requested stage access.

**Note**: If the local user is not a host, this property returns an empty list.

### Grant Access

To accept stage access requests or allow a participant directly to the stage, you can use the `grantAccess()` method. 
Alternatively, the `grantAccessAll()` method can be used to grant stage access to all participants with pending stage access requests.

```kotlin
// Grants stage access to a participant
// id: peer id of the stage access requesting participant
meeting.stage.grantAccess(id)

// Grants stage access to all participants with pending stage access requests
meeting.stage.grantAccessAll()
```

### Deny Access

To reject stage access requests, you can use the `denyAccess()` method. Similarly, the `denyAccessAll()` method can be used to 
deny all pending stage access requests.

```kotlin
// Denies stage access request of a participant
// id: peer id of the stage access requesting participant
meeting.stage.denyAccess(id)

// Denies all pending stage access requests
meeting.stage.denyAccessAll()
```

### Kick Users

You can remove a participant from the stage by using the `kick()` method.

```kotlin
// Kicks a participant from stage
// id: peer id of the ON_STAGE participant to kick
meeting.stage.kick(id)
```

### Listening to Stage Access Requests

You can listen to incoming stage access requests or changes in the access requests list if you are a host. The SDK provides the 
following callbacks to `DyteStageEventsListener`:

```kotlin
meeting.addStageEventsListener(object : DyteStageEventsListener {
    override fun onPresentRequestAdded(participant: DyteStageParticipant) {
        // Called when a user is requesting to join the stage
    }

    override fun onPresentRequestClosed(participant: DyteStageParticipant) {
        // Called when a user who was trying to join the stage leaves the call
    }

    override fun onPresentRequestRejected(participant: DyteStageParticipant) {
        // Called when a join stage request is denied by the host
    }

    override fun onPresentRequestWithdrawn(participant: DyteStageParticipant) {
        // Called when a user who was trying to join the stage withdraws their request to join
    }

    override fun onStageRequestsUpdated(accessRequests: List<DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant>) {
        // Called when the access requests list is updated
    }
})
```

These APIs enable you to manage stage access requests and participants effectively in Dyte meetings. Next, we'll explore the 
Stage APIs available to Viewer participants.
