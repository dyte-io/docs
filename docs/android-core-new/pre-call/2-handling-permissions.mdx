# Handling Browser Permissions

## Properties 

`self.mediaPermissions`: The current audio and video **browser permissions** given by the local
  user.

Permissions start with `NOT_REQUESTED` and can go into 4 different states


```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    NOT_REQUESTED --> ACCEPTED
    NOT_REQUESTED --> DENIED
    NOT_REQUESTED --> SYSTEM_DENIED
    NOT_REQUESTED --> COULD_NOT_START
```

<br />


- `ACCEPTED` - The user accepted browser permission prompts
- `DENIED` - The user denied browser permission prompts
- `SYSTEM_DENIED` - The user's browser does not have the required permission, in this case usually the OS hasn't granted permission the browser application
- `COULD_NOT_START` - Unable to start the selected device, you can retry with a different device

<br />

:::warning

One other thing to note down here is user might revoke permission later, or might unplug devices etc so these states can change at runtime

:::

<br />


Use the `mediaPermissionUpdate` event on `self` to listen for these changes

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    NOT_REQUESTED --> ACCEPTED
    NOT_REQUESTED --> DENIED
    NOT_REQUESTED --> SYSTEM_DENIED
    NOT_REQUESTED --> COULD_NOT_START
    ACCEPTED --> DENIED
    ACCEPTED --> COULD_NOT_START
    DENIED --> ACCEPTED
    COULD_NOT_START --> ACCEPTED 
```
