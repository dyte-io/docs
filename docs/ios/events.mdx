# Events

To integrate well with modern workflows, Dyte SDK also emits a rich set of
events on meeting events and state changes. Using these events on the client
side, you can make your app event driven and respond to changes in the meeting
in real-time. You can subscribe to the following events on the
[`DyteMeetingViewDelegate`](./reference/dyte-meeting-events). To do this, you
need to set the `delegate` for `DyteMeetingView` to an object (such as `self`)
that implements the `DyteMeetingViewDelegate` protocol. The methods in this
protocol correspond to events for the given meeting.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
dyteView.delegate = self
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
dyteView.delegate = self;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

While the delegate methods can now directly be implemented by the class that
`self` refers to if you are using Objective-C, you will have to go a little
roundabout way if you are using Swift. You would need to create an extension of
the class that extends the class using the protocol, and then from the delegate
method inside this extension you would need to call a private function of the
base class.

Remember the golden rule of thumb for iOS: all UI related operations need to be
dispatched on the `mainQueue`. Since delegates are asynchronous and are not
guaranteed to be called on the `mainQueue`, any delegates methods that deal with
UI need to explicitly specify the thread for such operations.

### Connected to the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant has connected to the meeting but
hasn't started producing or consuming content streams. Think of this as
establishing a successful connection to the meeting and nothing else.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func meetingConnected() {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) meetingConnected {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Joined the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant actually joins the meeting, and can
start producing as well as consuming content streams.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func meetingJoined() {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) meetingJoined {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Disconnected from the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant gets disconnected from the meeting
for any reason. It could be a bad network connection, the meeting being exited
by the participant manually, the meeting tab / browser / app being closed by the
participant, or just any other reason.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func meetingDisconnect() {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) meetingDisconnect {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Input media devices get connected to the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant's local media input devices
(camera, mic) are initialized and connected to the meeting for the first time.
Since the media device states can be toggled only after the device is connected,
you need to use this event to manage the starting state of participant's audio
or video.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func localMediaConnected() {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) localMediaConnected {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### End of the meeting

This event is triggered when the meeting is ended by the host or by the
organization (as an admin function). In this case, all the participants are
kicked out and you can take actions such as asking for feedback or redirecting
to an exercise.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func meetingEnded() {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) meetingEnded {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Another participant joins the meeting

This event is triggered when another participant joins the meeting. "Join" here
as the same context as the `meetingJoined` event: so when that event triggers
for the a participant, this event triggers for all other participants that have
already joined the meeting.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func participantJoin(participant) {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) participantJoin: (DyteParticipant *) participant {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Another participant leaves the meeting

This event is triggered when another participant disconnects from the meeting.
"Disconnect" here as the same context as the `disconnect` event: so when that
event triggers for the a participant, this event triggers for all other
participants that have already joined the meeting.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func participantLeave(participant) {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) participantLeave: (DyteParticipant *) participant {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Receiving a custom broadcast event

This event is triggered when a custom message is broadcast to all participants
in the meeting. A custom message may contain any serializable data.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func roomMessage(data) {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) roomMessage: (NSObject *) data {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Receiving a custom targeted event

This event is triggered when a custom message is targeted to a particular
participant in the meeting and only the target participant receives this event.
A custom message may contain any serializable data.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func message(data) {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) message: (NSObject *) data {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Detecting change in active speaker

This event is triggered when the active speaker in the meeting changes. Active
speaker is the participant whose audio level has most recently been the highest
(kind of like LRU with the selection factor being audio level). The
`participant` is an instance of `Participant`, whose prototype is defined below
in the reference section and can be directly used as a type if you prefer using
TypeScript bindings.

<Tabs
  groupId="ios-language"
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Obj-C", value: "obj-c" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
extension ViewController: DyteMeetingViewDelegate {
    func activeSpeaker(peerId) {
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="obj-c">

```objectivec
- (void) activeSpeaker: (NSString *) peerId {
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
