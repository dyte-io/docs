# Basic Usage

## Include Dyte's Flutter widget in your app

[`DyteMeeting`](./reference/dyte-meeting) is a Flutter widget that can be used
in your Flutter application to show the Dyte Meeting UI.

It has 3 mandatory and 2 optional properties. The mandatory ones are defined
below along with their usage, and the optional ones can be found
[here in the advanced usage](./advanced-usage#turn-on-the-setup--preview-screen)
page.

### Configure the meeting connection

You need to pass `authToken` and `roomName` to `DyteMeeting` to define which
meeting should the client connect to.

```dart {5-6}
SizedBox(
    width: <width>,
    height: <height>,
    child: DyteMeeting(
        roomName: "<roomName>",
        authToken: "<authToken>",
    )
)
```

### Get meeting instance on successful creation

You need to pass an `onInit` property to `DyteMeeting` to get reference to the
meeting instance that is created. `onInit` is an async callback function which
has a single param of type [`DyteMeetingHandler`](./reference/meeting). This
`DyteMeetingHandler` reference can be used to take further actions and make
customizations to the meeting.

```dart {7-9}
SizedBox(
    width: <width>,
    height: <height>,
    child: DyteMeeting(
        roomName: "<roomName>",
        authToken: "<authToken>",
        onInit: (DyteMeetingHandler meeting) async {
          // your handler
        },
    )
)
```
