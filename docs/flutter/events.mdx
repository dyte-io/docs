# Events

To integrate well with modern workflows, Dyte SDK also emits a rich set of
events on meeting events and state changes. Using these events on the client
side, you can make your app event driven and respond to changes in the meeting
in real-time. You can subscribe to the following events on the `meeting` object,
which is an instance of [`Meeting`](./reference/meeting).

### Connected to the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant has connected to the meeting but
hasn't started producing or consuming content streams. Think of this as
establishing a successful connection to the meeting and nothing else.

<!-- ```dart
meeting.events.on('connect', this, (ev, cont) {

});
``` -->

```dart
meeting.events.on('meetingConnected', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### Joined the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant actually joins the meeting, and can
start producing as well as consuming content streams.

```dart
meeting.events.on('meetingJoin', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### Disconnected from the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant gets disconnected from the meeting
for any reason. It could be a bad network connection, the meeting being exited
by the participant manually, the meeting tab / browser / app being closed by the
participant, or just any other reason.

```dart
meeting.events.on('meetingDisconnected', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### End of the meeting

This event is triggered when the meeting is ended by the host or by the
organization (as an admin function). In this case, all the participants are
kicked out and you can take actions such as asking for feedback or redirecting
to an exercise.

```dart
meeting.events.on('meetingEnd', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### Input media devices get connected to the meeting

This event is triggered when the participant's local media input devices
(camera, mic) are initialized and connected to the meeting for the first time.
Since the media device states can be toggled only after the device is connected,
you need to use this event to manage the starting state of participant's audio
or video.

```dart
 meeting.events.on('localMediaConnected', null, (a, b) {

 });
```

### Another participant joins the meeting

This event is triggered when another participant joins the meeting. "Join" here
as the same context as the `meetingJoined` event: so when that event triggers
for the a participant, this event triggers for all other participants that have
already joined the meeting.

```dart
import 'package:dyte_client/dyteParticipant.dart';
meeting.events.on('participantJoin', this, (ev, cont) {
    DyteParticipant p = ev.eventData as DyteParticipant;
});
```

### Another participant leaves the meeting

This event is triggered when another participant disconnects from the meeting.
"Disconnect" here as the same context as the `disconnect` event: so when that
event triggers for the a participant, this event triggers for all other
participants that have already joined the meeting.

```dart
import 'package:dyte_client/dyteParticipant.dart';
meeting.events.on('participantLeave', this, (ev, cont) {
    DyteParticipant p = ev.eventData as DyteParticipant;
});
```

<!-- ### Receiving a chat message

This event is triggered when the participant receives a chat message. The `chatMessage` is an instance of [`ChatMessage`](./reference/chat-message), whose prototype is defined in the reference section and can be directly used as a type if you prefer using TypeScript bindings.

```dart
meeting.events.on('chatMessage', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### Receiving a custom broadcast event

This event is triggered when a custom message is broadcast to all participants in the meeting. A custom message may contain any serializable data. You can read more on how to [send these messages here](./advanced-usage#send-a-custom-message-to-other-participants-in-the-meeting-p2p-message--data-exchange).

```dart
meeting.events.on('roomMessage', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### Receiving a custom targeted event

This event is triggered when a custom message is targeted to a particular participant in the meeting and only the target participant receives this event. A custom message may contain any serializable data. You can read more on how to [send these messages here](./advanced-usage#send-a-custom-message-to-other-participants-in-the-meeting-p2p-message--data-exchange).

```dart
meeting.events.on('message', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### Detecting change in active speaker

This event is triggered when the active speaker in the meeting changes. Active speaker is the participant whose audio level has most recently been the highest (kind of like LRU with the selection factor being audio level). The `participant` is an instance of `Participant`, whose prototype is defined below in the reference section and can be directly used as a type if you prefer using TypeScript bindings.

```dart
meeting.events.on('activeSpeaker'  this,((ev, cont) =
> {
});
```

### Recording started (version > 0.3.11)

This event is triggered when a recording of the meeting is started by the host or by the organization (as an admin function). You can use this event to show a popup or a warning to the participants about the meeting being recorded.

```dart
meeting.events.on('recordingStarted', this, (ev, cont) {

});
```

### Recording stopped (version > 0.3.11)

This event is triggered when a recording of the meeting is started by the host or by the organization (as an admin function). You can use this event to tell the participants about the recording being stopped.

```dart
meeting.events.on('recordingStopped', this, (ev, cont) {

});
``` -->
