# Basic Usage

## Include Dyte's React Native component in your app

[`DyteMeeting`](./reference/dyte-meeting) is a React Native component that can
be included in your React Native application to show the Dyte Meeting UI.

It has 3 mandatory and 2 optional properties. The mandatory ones are defined
below along with their usage, and the optional ones can be found
[here in the advanced usage](./advanced-usage#turn-on-the-setup--preview-screen)
page.

### Pass Client ID for verification

You need to pass a `clientId` prop to `DyteMeeting` to verify the participant's
`authToken` against.

```jsx {2}
<DyteMeeting
  clientId=`yourClientID`
>
```

### Configure the meeting connection

You need to pass a `meetingConfig` prop to `DyteMeeting` to define which meeting
should the client connect to and a couple of other setup parameters, out of
which only `authToken` and `roomName` are mandatory.

```jsx {3-6}
<DyteMeeting
  clientId=`yourClientID`
  meetingConfig={{
      roomName: `roomName`,
      authToken: `authToken`
  }}
>
```

### Get meeting instance on successful creation

You need to pass an `onInit` prop to `DyteMeeting` to get reference to the
meeting instance that is created. `onInit` expects a function which has a single
param of type [`Meeting`](./reference/meeting) and is not expected to return
anything. This `Meeting` reference can be used to take further actions and make
customizations to the meeting.

```jsx {2}
<DyteMeeting
  onInit={(meeting) => { }}
  clientId=`yourClientID`
  meetingConfig={{
      roomName: `roomName`,
      authToken: `authToken`
  }}
>
```
