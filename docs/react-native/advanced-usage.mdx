# Advanced usage

## Turn on the setup / preview screen

The audio / video setup screen that appears for the participant right before
getting into the meeting is turned off by default. You can set `showSetupScreen`
in `meetingConfig` to `true` to turn it on (default value is `false`).

```jsx {7}
<DyteMeeting
  onInit={(meeting) => { }}
  clientId=`yourClientID`
  meetingConfig={{
      roomName: `roomName`,
      authToken: `authToken`,
      showSetupScreen: true
  }}
>
```

## Dynamic codec switching

Dyte uses VP9 codec by default, but switches to H264/VP8 depending on
participants' video codec support. VP9 is a superior codec but not all browsers
support it. If you set `autoTune` in `meetingConfig` to `false`, Dyte will use
VP8 only for all participants (default value is `true`).

```jsx {7}
<DyteMeeting
  onInit={(meeting) => { }}
  clientId=`yourClientID`
  meetingConfig={{
      roomName: `roomName`,
      authToken: `authToken`,
      autoTune: false
  }}
>
```

## Get error details for meeting creation

You can optionally choose to subscribe to the error details, in case an error
occurs while joining a meeting from the client app, by passing an `onError` prop
to `DyteMeeting`. `onError` expects a function which has a single param of type
`Error` and is not expected to return anything.

```jsx {8}
<DyteMeeting
  onInit={(meeting) => { }}
  clientId=`yourClientID`
  meetingConfig={{
      roomName: `roomName`,
      authToken: `authToken`
  }}
  onError={(error) => { }}
>
```

You can refer to [this section](#errors) for info on errors.

## Control the meeting, and take meeting & participant actions

The `Meeting` instance (referenced as `meeting` above) helps you interact with
the meeting. You can take actions on the meeting as well as the participants.
You can also setup custom controls to that interact with the meeting in certain
ways that help you send events and messages across to other participants in the
meeting. You can find the complete reference to the `Meeting` type
[here](./reference/meeting). Read on to understand how to use these individual
controls.

## Get info about meeting's connection configuration

You can get the connection configuration of the meeting in progress using the
`connectionConfig` property of `Meeting`.

```javascript
let config = meeting.connectionConfig;
```

sets the value of `config` to the following:

```javascript
{
  clientId: string,
  roomName: string,
  showSetupScreen: boolean,
  autoTune: boolean,
}
```

## Get info about the meeting's UI configuration

You can get the UI configuration of the meeting in progress using the `uiConfig`
property of `Meeting`.

```javascript
let config = meeting.uiConfig;
```

sets the value of `config` to the following:

```javascript
{
    controlBar: boolean,
    controlBarElements: {
        fullscreen:   boolean,
        share:        boolean,
        screenShare:  boolean,
        layout:       boolean,
        chat:         boolean,
        polls:        boolean,
        participants: boolean,
        plugins:      boolean
    },
    header: boolean,
    headerElements: {
        logo:             boolean,
        title:            boolean,
        participantCount: boolean,
        clock:            boolean
    },
    dimensions:{
        width:  number,
        height: number
    },
    logo: string_url,
    colors: {
        primary:         string_hexColor
        secondary:       string_hexColor
        textPrimary:     string_hexColor
        videoBackground: string_hexColor
    }
}
```

## Get info about the plugins configured for the meeting

You can get info about the plugins configured for the meeting in progress using
the `plugins` property of `Meeting`.

```javascript
let plugins = meeting.plugins;
```

sets the value of `plugins` to an array of with elements that are instances of
type `DytePlugin`, whose prototype is defined below in the reference section and
can be directly used as a type if you prefer using TypeScript bindings.

<!-- ## Add (and remove) a custom button on the bottom control bar

You can add your own button with your custom handler, on the bottom control bar of the meeting. You can choose which section to place the button in, from the 3 sections, and the button placements would automatically be realigned to accommodate this new element.

To do this, you need to call the `addButton` method of `meeting.controlBar` and pass it an `icon` to display on the button, a `label` text to show below the icon, the `position` of button group where you want your button to show up (`left`, `center` & `right`), and the `onClick` handler.

```tsx
button = meeting.controlBar.addButton({
  icon: <div>ðŸ˜€</div>,
  label: "React",
  position: "center",
  onClick: () => {
    // your code to handle the click
  },
});
```

This would result in the following

!['react' button added to the control bar](/react-control-bar.png)

To remove this button, you can simply pass back the button reference to `removeButton` method of the same.

```javascript
meeting.controlBar.removeButton(button);
``` -->

## Replace the meeting control buttons with your own buttons

Let's say you don't want to give many options to the participants in a meeting,
other than the basic audio and video turning on, or you don't like our buttons
and control bar design (you really should give us feedback too, in this case),
or for any other reason - you just want to build your own buttons for basic
meeting controls. This is possible with Dyte, with the minor caveat that you
will need to put some validations at your end.

First thing in such a scenario would be to do away with our control bar

```javascript
meeting.updateUIConfig({ controlBar: false });
```

Now you can perform the basic functions of a meeting, like below. These
functions can be used as the `onClick` handlers of your own buttons.

### Mic control

To turn off the mic

```javascript
meeting.self.disableAudio();
```

To turn on the mic

```javascript
meeting.self.enableAudio();
```

### Camera control

To turn off the camera

```javascript
meeting.self.disableVideo();
```

To turn on the camera

```javascript
meeting.self.enableVideo();
```

### Screenshare control

To turn off screenshare

```javascript
meeting.self.disableScreenshare();
```

To turn on screenshare

```javascript
meeting.self.enableScreenshare();
```

### Leave meeting

To leave the meeting

```javascript
meeting.leaveRoom();
```

<!-- ## Add a custom action to the context (right-click) menu

You can add your own menu option to the context menu that appears on right clicking a participant's video (or thumbnail image where the video is supposed to be). The option gets placed at the bottom of the list.

To do this, you need to call the `addParticipantControl` method of `meeting` and pass it a `label` text to show in the menu, and the `onClick` handler which receives a `peerId` to indicate which participant's video was clicked upon.

```tsx
meeting.addParticipantControl({
  label: "React ðŸ˜€",
  onClick: (peerId) => {
    // your code to handle the click
  },
});
```

This would result in the following

!['react' button added to the context menu](/react-context-menu.png) -->

<!-- ## Change the video grid layout style

You can change the video grid layout from showing multiple participants in a grid (default) to only showing the active speaker or highlighted participant, and vice versa. Active speaker is the participant whose audio level has most recently been the highest (kind of like LRU with the selection factor being audio level). Call the `update` method of `meeting.grid` with the `layout` as either `meeting.grid.layouts.MULTI` or `meeting.grid.layouts.HIGHLIGHTED`.

```javascript
meeting.grid.update({
  layout: meeting.grid.layouts.MULTI | meeting.grid.layouts.HIGHLIGHTED,
});
```

- `MULTI`: This sets the participant videos in a grid.
- `HIGHLIGHTED`: This makes the selected participant video occupy the majority of the screen. -->

<!-- ## Change the cropping behaviour of videos

You can also change the participant's video fitting and cropping behaviour on the grid if it appears too cropped / zoomed in or too far away, using the same method as above. The parameter, however, would change to `fit` contained in `participantVideo` with the values of `contain` or `cover`.

```javascript
meeting.grid.update({
    participantVideo:
        fit: 'contain' | 'cover'
});
```

- `contain`: this option maintains the aspect ratio and fits the video inside the container in such a way that the longer side matches the container size and leaves margins around the shorter side.
- `cover`: this option ignores the aspect ratio and expands the video inside the container in such a way that the shorter side matches the container size to fill the container and there are no margins. -->

## Send a custom message to other participants in the meeting (P2P message / data exchange)

You can send custom messages relevant to your app, JSON data, or any really any
other data that is serializable, to other participants in the meeting. Think of
it as a parallel data channel in the same P2P manner as the media streams. While
the pre-built chat function supports sending messages and files, you can do more
using this feature. Since these messages do not appear in the chat box, you can
send and receive data specific to your app and choose to take actions as well as
display them on the UI as you want.

To send such a message to all participants in the meeting room

```javascript
meeting.sendRoomMessage(message);
```

where `message` can be of any type.

To send a targeted message to specific participant in the meeting room

```javascript
meeting.sendMessage(peerId, message);
```

where `message` can be of any type and `peerId` is a string representing the
unique ID of the participant as obtained from the participant list.

## Get list of all participants in the meeting

You can get a list of all participants in the meeting using the `participants`
property of `meeting`.

```javascript
let participantList = meeting.participants;
```

sets the `participantList` to an array whose elements are instances of type
`DyteParticipant`, whose prototype is defined below in the reference section and
can be directly used as a type if you prefer using TypeScript bindings. There
will be exactly one element of type `DyteSelfParticipant`, which refers to the
current participant.

## Controlling individual participants and actions

Dyte client SDK provide methods and properties to help you control participant
actions and certain UI elements. This could include actions that affect the
participant themselves as well as other participants (like a host with
privileged permissions may want to control the video of other participants).
This section defines all the possible properties and actions that can be taken.

:::info

Remember that despite the functions being available to every participant via the
client SDK, they will not take affect until coupled with the right permissions
for the participant who intends to use these.

:::

### Get participant list

To get a list of all participants, use `meeting.participants`: it returns
`Array[DyteParticipant|DyteSelfParticipant]` where all meeting participants are
[`DyteParticipant`](./reference/participant) and the current participant is
[`DyteSelfParticipant`](./reference/self-participant).

### Participant info and actions

Once you get the array of participants as mentioned above, you can iterate over
that and get certain info about every participant.

We will consider the following iterator for the next section.

```javascript
meeting.participants.forEach((p) => {
  // participant specific code goes here
});
```

#### Peer ID

Get unique ID for every participant. This ID is generated by Dyte when a
participant joins the meeting. This ID is used for referring to a participant
within Dyte, such as for
[sending custom messages](#send-a-custom-message-to-other-participants-in-the-meeting-p2p-message--data-exchange).

:::info

Even if the same participant, using the same auth token, rejoins the meeting,
for example by refreshing the page / app or due to connection drop, the peer ID
would be refreshed in that case.

:::

```javascript
let peerID = p.id;
```

sets the value of `peerID` to a UUID string.

#### Client specific ID

Get the client specific ID as you have specified in the add participant API
call. You may want to decide exposing custom controls or build other business
logic based on this identifier, which helps you find the participant info in
your system.

```javascript
let clientSpecificID = p.clientSpecificId;
```

#### Participant name

Get the participant name as you have specified in the add participant API call.
The participant may have changed this name, if enabled.

```javascript
let name = p.name;
```

#### Participant thumbnail photo / avatar

Get the participant photo as you have specified in the add participant API call.

```javascript
let name = p.picture;
```

#### Participant metadata about the preset

Get the preset that has been set for the participant either as a default or
explicitly as specified in the add participant API call.

```javascript
let preset = p.metadata.preset_name;
```

#### Participant metadata about the meeting view type

Get the view type that the participant is currently seeing.

```javascript
let preset = p.metadata.view_type;
```

#### Check if participant's audio is on

To check whether a participant's audio is on (mic is turned on), you can use

```javascript
let audio = p.audioEnabled;
```

which sets the value of `audio` to a boolean specifying if the mic is on or not.

#### Get participant audio stream

If the participant's audio is on, you can get the associated audio stream using

```javascript
let audioStream = p.audioTrack;
```

which sets the value of `audioStream` to a `MediaStreamTrack` that you can use
elsewhere such as a custom recording.

#### Disable participant's audio stream

To remotely turn the participant's mic off, you can do

```javascript
p.disableAudio();
```

#### Check if participant's video is on

To check whether a participant's video is on (camera is turned on), you can use

```javascript
let video = p.videoEnabled;
```

which sets the value of `video` to a boolean specifying if the camera is on or
not.

#### Get participant video stream

If the participant's video is on, you can get the associated video stream using

```javascript
let videoStream = p.videoTrack;
```

which sets the value of `videoStream` to a `MediaStreamTrack` that you can use
elsewhere such as a custom recording.

#### Disable participant's audio stream

To remotely turn the participant's camera off, you can do

```javascript
p.disableVideo();
```

#### Check if the participant is pinned to the grid

To check whether a participant's video is pinned to the meeting grid; by the
host, by the user, by the preset, or by any other mechanism; you can use

```javascript
let pinned = p.isPinned;
```

which sets the value of `pinned` to a boolean specifying whether the video is
pinned or not.

#### Pin a participant video to the grid

You can pin a participant's video to the grid using

```javascript
p.pin();
```

#### Unpin a participant video from the grid

You can unpin a participant's video from the grid using

```javascript
p.unpin();
```

#### Zoom a participant's video using custom logic

You can zoom on to a participant's video for everyone in the meeting. You would
need to specify the `scale`, which represents the scale of zoom, as well as `x`
and `y` offsets, which represent the offset from center to reposition the video
inside the container in the grid.

```javascript
p.zoom({ scale: , x: , y: });
```

<!-- #### Set an overlay / filter on the participant video

You can add overlays or filters to individual participants. For this, you can do `participant.setOverlay(ReactNode)` where you pass either a React Component or HTML string to the function.

Let's say you find the `participant` using their `id` or something similar, and then

```javascript
const targetPeer = meeting.participants.find((p) => p.id === peerId);
// find a peer you want to add overlay to
if (targetPeer) {
  targetPeer.setOverlay(
    '<canvas id="reaction-1" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;" />'
  );
}
```

To remove, you can simply set the overlay to null.

```javascript
targetPeer.setOverlay(null);
``` -->

#### Send a custom message to a participant (P2P message / data exchange)

Just like
[sending a custom message to the whole room](#send-a-custom-message-to-other-participants-in-the-meeting-p2p-message--data-exchange),
you can target a particular participant to send a message.

```javascript
p.sendMessage(message);
```

#### Check if the participant is current participant

You can check if the participant is the current participant by checking the
`isMe` boolean property of the participant. If found to be `true`, you can treat
that participant as an instance of type `DyteSelfParticipant`, which is a
subclass of type `DyteParticipant`. This unlocks a few additional actions that
you can take with that participant.

```javascript
let currentParticipant = meeting.participants.find((p) => p.isMe);
```

Now all the methods that you can call on `meeting.self` (as described under
[replace meeting control buttons](#replace-the-meeting-control-buttons-with-your-own-buttons))
can be called on `currentParticipant`.

## Errors

There are 3 types of errors emitted when a meeting cannot be initialized. Read
more about these on the [`DyteErrors`](./reference/dyte-errors) page in the
reference section.

```tsx
enum DyteErrors {
  CLIENTID_INVALID,
  MEETING_UNAUTHORIZED,
  MEETING_NOTFOUND,
}
```

An example of handling such errors:

```tsx
import { DyteMeeting, DyteErrors } from "@dyte/client";

// ...
// ...

<DyteMeeting
    onInit={(meeting) => { }}
    clientId=`yourClientID`
    meetingConfig={{
        roomName: `roomName`,
        authToken: `authToken`
    }}
    onError={(error) => {
        if (error = DyteErrors.CLIENTID_INVALID) {
            // take appropriate action
        }
    }}
>
```
