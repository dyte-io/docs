# Quickstart

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.

:::

Get the `roomName` for the meeting and the participant's `authToken` from our
backend APIs (read more about our server APIs [here](/api/)), and pass them as
props to Dyte's `DyteMeeting` React Native component.

You can initialize a meeting in your React Native app, using this component,
like below.

```jsx
import { DyteMeeting } from '@dytesdk/mobile';

function App() {
  return (
    <DyteMeeting
      onInit={(meeting) => {}}
      clientId={`orgId || clientId`}
      meetingConfig={{
        roomName: `roomName`,
        authToken: `authToken`,
      }}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```
