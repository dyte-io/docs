### Breaking changes

With this major release we tried to reduce the number of breaking changes to the minimal amount.

**1. Removal of V1 REST API terminology in favor of V2 REST API terminology**

- meeting.self.`clientSpecificId` - > meeting.self.`customParticipantId`
- meeting.meta.`roomName` → meeting.meta.`meetingId`
- meeting.self.`suggestedTheme` → meeting.self.`config`
- Dropped meeting.meta.`joined` (Duplicate of meeting.self.`joined`)


**2. Event changes ️‍🔥 ️‍🔥 ️‍🔥**

Network disconnects now trigger roomLeft event on meeting.self with a state indicating the cause of leaving the room. If you have redirection logic on `roomLeft`, please update it accordingly.

```jsx
meeting.self.on('roomLeft', ({ state }) => {
	if(state === 'ended' || state == "left" || state == "kicked"){
		// maybe redirect to another page
	}
}
```

Possible state values are ‘kicked’ | 'ended' | 'left'  | 'rejected' | 'connected-meeting' | 'disconnected' | 'failed';

**3. Handling Reconnection / Disconnection**

- `connected` `disconnected` `connectionError` `iceConnected` `iceDisconnected` `iceFailed` `iceReconnecting` `socketConnected` `socketDisconnected` `socketReconnecting` `socketReconnectAttempt` `socketReconnectFailure` `socketReconnected` `socketFailure`
    
    events on meeting.meta are **removed and replaced** with new simplified connection events and properties
    
    - Updates to Media connection (WebRTC connection used for the transfer of actual media) will be sent on `mediaConnectionUpdate` event with the payload    
      You can also get the value of this payload by checking the `meeting.meta.mediaState` property
    
    - Updates to Websocket connection (used for chat, polls and other basic signaling) will be sent on `socketConnectionUpdate` event.    
      You can also get the value of this payload by checking the `meeting.meta.socketState` property
