# Media Permission Errors

This event is triggered when Dyte fails to acquire the user's local media
(camera and/or microphone) or user revokes the permission for media devices.

Your application can catch these errors like below:

```
meeting.self.on('mediaPermissionError', ({
    message,
    kind
}) => {
    console.log(`Failed to capture ${kind}:  ${message}`);
});
```

This event shares information that can be used to show appropriate message for
the user.

Possible values for **message** are

    DENIED  - Permission was denied by the user

    SYSTEM_DENIED   - Permission was denied by the system

    COULD_NOT_START - Failed to capture media stream from the hardware

Possible values for **kind** - `audio`, `video`, `screenshare`
