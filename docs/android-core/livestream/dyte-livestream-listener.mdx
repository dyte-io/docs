You can listen to livestream events by attaching a listener by calling `addLivestreamEventsListener` on `dyteMobileClient` object where `dyteMobileClient` is an instance of `DyteMobileClient()`.

```kotlin
val dyteLiveStreamEventsListener = object : DyteLiveStreamEventsListener {
  override fun onLiveStreamStarting() {
    // when livestream is starting
  }

  override fun onLiveStreamStarted() {
    // when livestream is started
  }

  override fun onLiveStreamEnding() {
    // when livestream is ending
  }

  override fun onLiveStreamEnded() {
    // when livestream is ended
  }

  override fun onLiveStreamErrored() {
    // errored livestream
  }

  override fun onViewerCountUpdated(count: Int) {
    // when viewer count updates in livestream
  }

  override fun onStageCountUpdated(count: Int) {
    // when stage count updates in livestream
  }

  override fun onStageRequestsUpdated(requests: List<LiveStreamStageRequestPeer>) {
    // when there are updates in stage requests
  }

  override fun onJoinRequestAccepted(peer: LiveStreamStagePeer) {
    // when localUser's join request is accepted by host
  }

  override fun onJoinRequestRejected(peer: LiveStreamStagePeer) {
    // when localUser's join request is rejected by host
  }

  override fun onLiveStreamStateUpdate(data: DyteLivestreamData) {
    // when there is an update in state of the livestream
  }
}
meeting.addLiveStreamEventsListener(dyteLiveStreamEventsListener)
```
