In a stage management-enabled meeting, a user with the `permissions.host.canAcceptStageRequests` permission as `true` is
considered a host. The `meeting.stage` object in Dyte's Android Core SDK provides stage management APIs that allow hosts to
manage stage access requests, invite participants to the stage, and remove participants from the stage.

### List of Stage Access Requests

You can retrieve the list of pending stage access requests by accessing the `meeting.stage.accessRequests` property. This property
provides a list of `DyteRemoteParticipant` objects who have requested stage access.

**Note**: If the local user is not a host, this property returns an empty list.

### Grant Access

To accept stage access requests or allow a participant directly to the stage, you can use the `grantAccess()` method.

```kotlin
// Grants stage access to a participant
// id: peer id of the stage access requesting participant
meeting.stage.grantAccess(listOf(id))

// Grants stage access to all pending stage access requests
meeting.stage.grantAccess(meeting.stage.accessRequests.map { it.userId })
```

### Deny Access

To reject stage access requests, you can use the `denyAccess()` method.

```kotlin
// Denies stage access request of a participant
// id: peer id of the stage access requesting participant
meeting.stage.denyAccess(listOf(id))

// Denies all pending stage access requests
meeting.stage.denyAccess(meeting.stage.accessRequests.map { it.userId })
```

### Kick Users

You can remove a participant from the stage by using the `kick()` method.

```kotlin
// Kicks a participant from stage
// id: peer id of the ON_STAGE participant to kick
meeting.stage.kick(listOf(id))
```

### Listening to Stage Access Requests

You can listen to incoming stage access requests or changes in the access requests list if you are a host. The SDK provides the
following callbacks to `DyteStageEventListener`:

```kotlin
meeting.addStageEventListener(object : DyteStageEventListener {
    override fun onNewStageAccessRequest(participant: DyteRemoteParticipant) {
        // Called when a new stage access request is received from a participant.
    }

    override fun onStageAccessRequestsUpdated(accessRequests: List<DyteRemoteParticipant>) {
        // Called when the list of stage access requests is updated.
    }
})
```

These APIs enable you to manage stage access requests and participants effectively in Dyte meetings. Next, we'll explore the
Stage APIs available to Viewer participants.
