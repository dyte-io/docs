# Introducing chat

The meeting chat object is stored in `meeting.chat`, which has methods for sending and receiving messages. There are 3 types of messages that can be sent in chat - text messages, images, and files.

The `meeting.chat.messages` array contains all the messages that have been sent
in the chat. This is an array of objects, where each object is of type
`DyteChatMessage`.

We support three types of chat messages, they are as follows

- Text Message

```kotlin
class DyteTextMessage(
  userId: String,
  displayName: String,
  read: Boolean,
  pluginId: String?,
  val message: String,
  time: String,
  createdAtMillis: Long,
  targetUserIds: List<String>?,
)
```

- Image Message

```kotlin
class DyteImageMessage(
  userId: String,
  displayName: String,
  read: Boolean,
  pluginId: String?,
  val link: String,
  time: String,
  createdAtMillis: Long,
  targetUserIds: List<String>?,
)
```

- File Message

```kotlin
class DyteFileMessage(
  userId: String,
  displayName: String,
  read: Boolean,
  pluginId: String?,
  val name: String,
  time: String,
  createdAtMillis: Long,
  val link: String,
  val size: Long,
  targetUserIds: List<String>?,
)
```

All above objects are of type `DyteChatMessage` along with their own class
variables.
