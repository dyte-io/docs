# Receiving chat messages

To be able to receive chat messages you need to implement a method
`onChatUpdates()` method from callback `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addMeetingEventsListener(dyteMeetingRoomEventsListener)`

```kotlin
    meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object :
      DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
      override fun onChatUpdates(
        newMessage: Boolean,
        message: DyteChatMessage?,
        messages: List<DyteChatMessage>
      ) {
        super.onChatUpdates(newMessage, message, messages)
        // your code to handle new chat message
      }
    })
```

Here, the `message` is of type `Message`, as defined in
[introduction](./introduction). `messages` is a list of all chat messages in the
meeting, which is the same as `meeting.chat.messages`.

When a chat message is received, the `meeting.chat.messages` list is also
updated.
