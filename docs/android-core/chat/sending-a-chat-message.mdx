# Sending a chat message

As mentioned in [introduction](./introduction), there are 3 types of chat messages - text messages, images, and files. There is a method in `meeting.chat` to send a message of each type.

## Send a text message

To send a text message, the `meeting.chat.sendTextMessage()` method can be used. This accepts a string `message` and sends it to the room.

```kotlin
val message = "Is this the real life?"
meeting.chat.sendTextMessage(message)
```

## Send an image

You can send an image with the help of `meeting.chat.sendImageMessage()` and
sends it to the participants in the meeting.

```kotlin
meeting.chat.sendImageMessage(fileUri) { err ->
  // Handle error if any
}
```

## Send a file

Sending a file is quite similar to sending an image. The only difference is that when you send an image, a preview will be shown in the meeting chat, which is not the case for sending files. That being said, an image can be sent as a file too using `meeting.chat.sendFileMessage()`.

```kotlin
meeting.chat.sendFileMessage(fileUri) { err ->
  // Handle error if any
}
```

## Error types

The `sendTextMessage` method does not have a callback function, so it does not return an error object of type `ChatTextError`. It can be the following:

- PermissionDenied: The user does not have permission to send a message.
- MessageIsBlank: The message is empty.
- CharacterLimitExceeded: The message exceeds the character limit.
- RateLimitBreached: The user has sent too many messages in a short period of time.

Both `sendImageMessage` and `sendFileMessage` methods accept a callback function that will be called with an error object if there is an error while sending the message.

The error object is of type `ChatFileError`, which can be classified into the following:

- FileFormatNotAllowed: The file format is not allowed.
- PermissionDenied: The user does not have permission to send a file.
- RateLimitBreached: The user has sent too many files in a short period of time.
- ReadFailed: The file could not be read.
- UploadFailed: The file could not be uploaded.

A `when` block can be used to handle these errors inside the callback, as shown below:

```kotlin
when (err) {
  is ChatFileError.FileFormatNotAllowed -> {}
  is ChatFileError.PermissionDenied -> {}
  is ChatFileError.RateLimitBreached -> {}
  is ChatFileError.ReadFailed -> {}
  is ChatFileError.UploadFailed -> {}
  else -> {}
}
```
