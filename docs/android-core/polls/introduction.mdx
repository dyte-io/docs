# Introduction

The meetings polls object can be accessed using `meeting.polls`. It provides
methods to create polls, vote, and more.

`meeting.polls.polls` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where
each element is an object of type `DytePollMessage`.

The type `DytePollMessage` is the main class for any poll in Dyte. It also
contains list of `DytePollOption` which are options for a given poll. And every
`DytePollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class
`DytePollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

One can easily create, vote and view polls by listening to callbacks on
`meeting` object.

## Listening to new polls in a meeting

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method
`onPollUpdates()` method from callback `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addMeetingEventsListener(dyteMeetingRoomEventsListener)`

```kotlin
    meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object :
      DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
      override fun onNewPoll(poll: DytePollMessage) {
        // code to handle new poll
      }

      override fun onPollUpdates(pollMessages: List<DytePollMessage>) {
        // code to handle polls and their vote updates.
      }
    })
```
