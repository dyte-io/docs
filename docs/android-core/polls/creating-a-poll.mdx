# Creating a poll

A new poll can be created using the `create` method from the
[`meeting.polls`](./introduction) object. The `meeting.polls.create()` method
accepts the following params.

| Param     | Type     | Default Value | Required | Description                                |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| question  | string   | -             | yes      | The question that is to be voted for.      |
| options   | string[] | -             | yes      | The options of the poll.                   |
| anonymous | boolean  | -             | no       | If true, the poll votes are anonymous.     |
| hideVotes | boolean  | -             | no       | If true, the votes on the poll are hidden. |

The following snippet creates a poll where votes are anonymous.

```kotlin
meeting.poll.create(
    "Are you an early bird or a night owl?",
    listOf("Early bird", "Night owl"),
    true,
    false
)
```
