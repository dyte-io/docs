# Waiting Room

When you call `meeting.joinRoom()`, the user either enters the meeting room directly if allowed, or they are placed in the waiting room 
if they are a waitlisted participant.

The diagram illustrates the possible room states the local user can be in.

```

### Meeting Room Joined

If user joins the room successfully, you receive the `onMeetingRoomJoinCompleted` callback in `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. 
You can listen for this callback as follows:

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRoomJoinCompleted() {
        // Local user is in the meeting
    }
})
```

### Waitlisted Participant

If the user is waitlisted, the `onWaitListStatusUpdate` callback in `DyteSelfEventsListener` notifies you of any changes in the 
user's waitlist status. You can check the `waitListStatus` to determine their status:

- `WAITING`: Local user is in the waiting room.
- `REJECTED`:  Local user's join room request is rejected by the host.

```kotlin
meeting.addSelfEventsListener(object : DyteSelfEventsListener {
    override fun onWaitListStatusUpdate(waitListStatus: WaitListStatus) {
        when (waitListStatus) {
            WAITING -> {
                // Local user is in the waiting room
            }
            REJECTED -> {
                // Local user's join room request was rejected by the host
            }
            else -> { }
        }
    }
})
```

Host can use [these methods to accept/reject participants](/android-core/participants#waiting-room-methods).
