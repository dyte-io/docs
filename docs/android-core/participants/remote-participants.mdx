# Participant Types

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. These **does not** include the local user. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. For example, to get all the participants who joined the meeting:

<Tabs groupId="android-core-participants">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin" default>

```kotlin
// get all joined participants
val joined: List<DyteRemoteParticipant> = meeting.participants.joined

// get active participants
val active: List<DyteRemoteParticipant> = meeting.participants.active
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="java" label="Java" default>

```java
// get all joined participants
List<DyteRemoteParticipant> joined = meeting.getParticipants().getJoined();

// get active participants
List<DyteRemoteParticipant> active = meeting.getParticipants().getActive();
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `meeting.participants` object has the following **lists** of participants

- **joined**: A list that contains all the participants who are currently in the meeting
  except the local user
- **waitlisted**: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the
  meeting.
- **active**: A list that contains all the participants, **excluding** the local user whose media is subscribed to i.e participants who are supposed to be on the screen at the moment, except the local user.
- **pinned**: A list that contains all the pinned participants of the meeting.
- **screenShares**: A list that contains all the participants who are sharing their screen.

Therefore if you were to make a video / audio grid of participants, you'd use the `active` list, but to display the list of all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined` list.
