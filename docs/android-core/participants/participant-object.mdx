# The participant object

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data.

The `participant` object consists of all the information related to a particular participant. For instance, it contains a participants video/audio/screenshare stream, and the participant's name. It also contains state variables that indicate whether a participant's camera is on or off, and whether they are muted or unmuted.

The participant object has the following properties.

- `id`: The `participantId` of the participant (aka `peerId`).
- `userId`: The `userId` of the participant.
- `name`: The participant's name.
- `picture`: The participant's picture (if any).
- `clientSpecificId`: An arbitrary ID that can be set to identify the
  participant.
- `videoTrack`: The video track of the participant.
- `screenShareTrack`: The video and audio (if any) track of the participant's
  screen share stream.
- `videoEnabled`: Set to true if the participant's camera is on.
- `audioEnabled`: Set to true if the participant is unmuted.
- `isPinned`: True if current user is pinned in the meeting room.
- `presetName`: Name of the preset associated with the participant.
- `stageStatus`: Status of stage for the participant
- `maxNumberOnScreen`: A int showing the maximum number of people set for this meeting.
- `currentPageNumber`: A int showing the current page in this meeting. Participants from this page are filled in the `active` list.
- `pageCount`: A int showing total number of pages available in the meeting.
- `canGoNextPage`: A boolean indicating if next page of joined participants is available to show.
- `canGoPreviousPage`: A boolean indicating if previous page of joined participants is available to show.

## To get video view of a given participant

You can call `participant.getVideoView()` which will return a View which further
can used to add in any ViewGroup in android.

Similarly one can use `participant.getScreenShareView()` which will return a
View which further can used to add in any ViewGroup in android.

Similarly, you can also access the pagination related information like follows:

```kotlin
val maxNumberOnScreen = meeting.participants.maxNumberOnScreen
val currentPageNumber = meeting.participants.currentPageNumber
val pageCount = meeting.participants.pageCount
val canGoNextPage = meeting.participants.canGoNextPage
val canGoPreviousPage = meeting.participants.canGoPreviousPage
```

## Move between pages in paginated mode

The `setPage(pageNumber: Int)` method allows you to switch between pages of participants present in the meeting.

```kotlin
// switch to 1st page
meeting.participants.setPage(1)
```

## Host Controls

If you (the local user) have the relevant permissions, you can disable a participant's video or audio, or kick them from the meeting.

```kotlin
val participant = meeting.participants.joined.firstOrNull { it.id == participantId }

participant?.let { pcpt ->
  // To disable a participant's video stream
  pcpt.disableVideo();

  // To disable a participant's audio stream
  pcpt.disableAudio();

  // To kick a participant from the meeting
  pcpt.kick();
}
```

You can also `pin` or `unpin` a participant in the meeting. All "pinned"
participants are added to the `meeting.participants.pinned` list.

```kotlin
val participant = meeting.participants.joined.firstOrNull { it.id == participantId }

participant?.let { pcpt ->
  // To pin a participant
  pcpt.pin();

  // To unpin a participant
  pcpt.unpin();
}
```

## Broadcast message to all participants

Send a message to all `joined` participants.

_Parameters_:

`type`: A client-specific type to differentiate between custom messages like "emoji" or "greetings"

`payload`: A map containing the message payload, where keys are strings and values are of `Any` type.

```kotlin
// broadcast message
meeting.participants.broadcastMessage(type, payload)
```
