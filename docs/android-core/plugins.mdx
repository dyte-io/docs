# Plugins

The meetings plugins can be accessed using `meeting.plugins`. It provides two
main objects, `all` which contains list of all Plugin objects in a
`DyteMeeting`. And `active` list which contains plugins which are enabled and
are currently being used in this meeting.

## Playing with plugins

Plugins are webviews which can be added in any view group in android. To be able
to get webview from DytePlugin one needs to first acivate a plugin. To do that
all we need to do is call `plugin.active()` which will trigger a callback in
`onPluginActivated()`. Similarly to deactivate a plugin one can call
`plugin.deactivate()` and that plugin will be deactivated in the meeting.

```kotlin
plugin.activate() // to activate a plugin
plugin.deactivate()   // to deactivate a plugin
```

## Active plugin

To check if a `plugin` is active or not in a meeting one can use

```kotlin
val isActive = plugin.isActive
```

## Listening to plugins in a meeting

To be able to listen to plugin events you need to implement a methods from
callback `DytePluginEventsListener`. You can subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addPluginEventsListener(dytePluginEventsListener)`

```kotlin
    meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object :
      DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
      override fun onPluginActivated(plugin: DytePlugin) {
      super.onPluginActivated(plugin)
      // your code to handle plugin activation
    }

    override fun onPluginDeactivated(plugin: DytePlugin) {
      super.onPluginDeactivated(plugin)
      // your code to handle plugin de-activation
    }
```
