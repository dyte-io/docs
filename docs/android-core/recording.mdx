# Recording

The `meeting.recording` object can be used start and stop recordings in a
meeting. You can also get the current status of a recording using this API.

The `meeting.recording` object has the following properties:

- `recordingState`: Indicates the current recording state of the meeting.

## Start a recording

To start a recording, you can call the `start` method in the `meeting.recording`
object. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and `STOPPING`.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.start();
```

## Stop a recording

Call `meeting.recording.stop()` to stop the active recording.

```kotlin
meeting.recording.stop();
```

## Get active recording state

The `meeting.recording.recordingState` property describes the current state of
the recording. The valid states are `IDLE`, `STARTING`, `RECORDING`, and
`STOPPING`.

## Listen to recording state changes

The changes to `meeting.recording.recordingState` can be listened by
implementing `onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated` from
`DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. You can attach this observer by calling
`meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(listener)`.

```kotlin
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object : DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
    override fun onMeetingRecordingStarted() {
      super.onMeetingRecordingStarted()
      // on recording started
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingEnded() {
      super.onMeetingRecordingEnded()
      // on recording ended
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(state: DyteRecordingState) {
      super.onMeetingRecordingStateUpdated(state)
      // on recording state update
    }

    override fun onMeetingRecordingStopError(e: Exception) {
      super.onMeetingRecordingStopError(e)
      // when local user tried to end recording but it fails
    }
  })
```
