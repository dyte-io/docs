# Manage Media Devices

Media devices represents the hardware for the camera, microphone and speaker
devices. To get the list of media devices that are currently being used, you can
use the following methods:

```kotlin
// Get all audio devices
val audioDevices: List<DyteAudioDevice> = meeting.self.getAudioDevices();

// Get all video devices
val videoDevices: List<DyteVideoDevice> = meeting.self.getVideoDevices();
```

## Set audio device

To set a device as an active device, you can call `setAudioDevice` method. This
takes a `DyteAudioDevice` object.

```kotlin
meeting.self.setAudioDevice(device);
```
