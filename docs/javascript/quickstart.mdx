# Quickstart

Get the `roomName` for the meeting and the participant's `authToken` from our
backend APIs (read more about our server APIs [here](/api)), and pass them as
params to Dyte's `Meeting` class.

You can initialize a meeting on your JS enabled web page, like below.

```html
<div id="root"></div>
<script>
  const client = new DyteClient({ clientId: 'orgId|clientId' });

  const meeting = client.Meeting({
    roomName: '<roomName>',
    authToken: '<authToken>',
  });

  meeting.init('root');
</script>
```
