# Basic Usage

## Include Dyte Meeting in your app

`DyteClient` is a JavaScript library that can be included in your JavaScript
application to show the Dyte Meeting UI.

It has a [`Meeting`](./reference/meeting) component which can be initialized
using 2 mandatory and 2 optional properties. The mandatory ones are defined
below along with their usage, and the optional ones can be found
[here in the advanced usage](./advanced-usage#turn-on-the-setup--preview-screen)
page.

### Pass Client ID for verification

You need to pass a `clientId` to `DyteClient` to verify the participant's
`authToken` against.

```html {2}
<script>
  const client = new DyteClient({ clientId: 'orgId|clientId' });
</script>
```

### Configure the meeting connection

You need to pass a `meetingConfig` object to initialize the `Meeting`, to define
which meeting should the client connect to and a couple of other setup
parameters, out of which only `authToken` and `roomName` are mandatory. This
`Meeting` reference can be used to take further actions and make customizations
to the meeting.

```html {4-7}
<script>
  const client = new DyteClient({ clientId: 'orgId|clientId' });

  const meeting = client.Meeting({
    roomName: '<roomName>',
    authToken: '<authToken>',
  });
</script>
```

### Initialize the meeting in its parent container

You need to call the `init` method on `meeting` and pass it the `id` of the
parent container in which you want the meeting to get initialized.

```html {9}
<script>
  const client = new DyteClient({ clientId: 'orgId|clientId' });

  const meeting = client.Meeting({
    roomName: '<roomName>',
    authToken: '<authToken>',
  });

  meeting.init('root');
</script>
```
