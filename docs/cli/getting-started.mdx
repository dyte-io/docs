# Getting started

The Dyte CLI needs a little bit of work to get started. We're working on
reducing the amount of effort required, but for now you'll have to do the
following.

## Configuration

1. Authorize yourself with the Dyte Dev Portal. This allows you to access all
   the organizations that you belong to from the CLI.

```shell
dyte auth login
```

2. Select the organization you want to run commands in the context of.

```bash
dyte auth org
```

## Usage

### General

The Dyte CLI is
[POSIX compliant](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html).
This means in general, a command has the following format:

```shell
dyte <command> [subcommand] [options]
```

### Getting help

The `dyte help` command shows you a comprehensive list of all the top-level
commands and a short description of what each command does. You can run
`dyte <command> help` to know more about the command and its subcommands (if
any).

```shell
dyte help
```

![cli-help](/static/cli/cli-help.png#terminal) _Dyte help screen_

### Switching organizations

Simply run the following command again to switch to another organization. The
list of organizations can be filtered by name or ID.

```shell
dyte auth org
```
