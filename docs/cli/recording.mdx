# Recordings

The CLI lets you start, stop, view and configure meeting recordings.

## Configuration

Set up your recording configuration by running:

```shell
dyte recordings config
```

You will be asked a series of questions about the configuration you'd like for
your recordings.

:::tip If you don't know the answers to these questions, it's fine to skip this
step. Our defaults are robust! :::

## Controlling recordings

### Starting

You can start recording a meeting by running:

```shell
dyte recordings start <meeting id>
```

### Stopping

You can end a recording by running:

```shell
dyte recordings stop <meeting id>
```

:::tip The meeting ID can be a UUID, eg: `f68a59ca-5e43-4267-8982-bfcabcab88a3`
or it can be the simple ID used by our meetings in the browser, eg:
`aoiler-tlmbwi` :::

## Viewing recordings

### Listing

You can view a list of all recordings for a meeting by running:

```shell
dyte recordings list
```

### Getting a particular recording

You can view the details for a particular recording by running

```shell
dyte recordings get <meeting id> <recording id>
```

:::tip The `dyte recordings stop` command will helpfully output the complete
command you need to retrieve that particular recording! :::
