# Plugins

You may create, manage, and host your own custom plugins with the help of the
`dyte plugins` subcommand.

## Overview

You can publish plugins for your organization on Dyte. We manage only the
client-side code for plugins, the backend for a plugin (if any) **will not** be
hosted by Dyte. Therefore, server-side templating is not supported in plugins.

Every functional Dyte plugin requires a configuration file, which is named
`dyte-config.json` by default. This contains details about the plugin such as
the `pluginId`, `name`, `version`, `description`, etc. This file is
auto-generated upon running the `dyte plugins create` command, which is
explained in detail later. You can know more about the `dyte-config.json` file
in the description for the `publish` subcommand.

## TL;DR

In order to create and publish a plugin, you need to do the following.

1. Run `dyte plugins create`, and enter the details. This should create a
   `dyte-config.json` file.
2. Copy the `dyte-config.json` into the folder containing the `index.html` file
   of your plugin. If you're using a frontend library like React, this would be
   the build folder.
3. Change your directory to the folder containing the `index.html` and
   `dyte-config.json` files.
4. Modify the `dyte-config.json` file to update the version and the files that
   will be included and excluded while generating the plugin archive.
5. Run `dyte plugins publish -l` or `dyte plugins publish --latest` to upload
   and serve your plugin on Dyte.

## Usage

### Creating a plugin

You can use the following subcommand to create a new Dyte plugin. This sends an
API request to register a new plugin under your organization. Additionally, it
creates a file called `dyte-config.json`, which is essential for the plugin to
function properly.

```shell
dyte plugins create
```

### Listing your plugins

The `list | ls` subcommand can be used to list the names and IDs of all plugins
that were created by your organization.

```shell
dyte plugins ls
```

### Viewing plugin details

The `describe` subcommand logs the details of a plugin. The `pluginId` is
required.

```shell
dyte plugins describe -p <plugin id>
```

### Deleting a plugin

With the help of the `delete | rm` subcommand, you can delete an existing
plugin. The `pluginId` is required.

```shell
dyte plugins rm -p <plugin id>
```

### Updating a plugin

To update the details of a plugin, you can use the `update` subcommand. The
`pluginId` is required.

```shell
dyte plugins update -p <plugin id>
```

## Releasing plugins

### Packaging a plugin

In order to publish a plugin, a `.dyt` archive is created with all the
client-side source code and the `dyte-config.json` file. This file is required
by the `publish` subcommand, which also internally generates this archive. You
can use the `pack` command if you just want to generate the archive, but do not
want to publish it.

```shell
dyte plugins pack
```

### Publishing a plugin

The `publish` subcommand handles publishing a plugin on Dyte. You must run this
command in the directory where the `dyte-config.json` and the `index.html` files
of your plugin are present. In the `dyte-config.json`, you can also describe the
files you want to include in and exclude from the archive. In order to publish a
plugin, you must follow these steps:

1. Copy the `dyte-config.json` (which was created by the `dyte plugins create`
   command) into the folder containing your `index.html` file. In case you're
   using a frontend library like React, you must copy `dyte-config.json` into
   the `build` folder.
2. Update the plugin version in `dyte-config.json`.
3. Run `dyte plugins publish -l`.

The `-l` or `--latest` option is **required** if you want your plugin's new
version to be deployed. If the `-l` option is absent, the new version of the
plugin will be saved in our storage bucket, but it will not be served. In that
case, an older version (if any) will be served. You may not use the `-l` option
if you want to upload your code to the storage bucket but you do not want to
serve it.

```shell
dyte plugins publish -l
```

### Unpublishing a plugin

The `unpublish` subcommand can be used if you want do not want your plugin to
show up on the Dyte plugins panel. The `pluginId` is required.

```shell
dyte plugins unpublish
```

:::caution Note that the plugin and its code will not be deleted, it will just
not show up on the panel (and thus become unusable). :::

## Versioning

The `version` subcommand has 3 subcommands of its own. The `pluginId` is
required for each of these subcommands.

### List

`version list` can be used to list all versions of your Dyte plugin.

```shell
dyte plugins version list
```

### Delete

`version delete` can be used to delete a particular version of your Dyte plugin.
This accepts the version you want to delete with the help of the `-v` option.

```shell
dyte plugins version delete -v <version>
```

### Change latest

`version change-latest` can be used to change the version of your plugin that is
served. This accepts the version you want to serve with the help of the `-v`
option.

```shell
dyte plugins version change-latest -v <version>
```
