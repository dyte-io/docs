# DyteNotifications

A component which handles notifications.

You can configure which notifications you want to see and which ones you want to hear.
There are also certain limits which you can set as well.

```jsx live
<DyteNotifications
  meeting={meeting}
  config={{
    config: {
      notifications: {
        participant_left: false,
      },
      notification_sounds: {
        participant_left: false,
      },
      participant_joined_sound_notification_limit: 10,
      participant_chat_message_sound_notification_limit: 10,
    },
  }}
/>
```

The configurations take a specific category of notifications. Available
categories are `participant_joined`, `participant_left`,
`participant_joined_waitlist`, `chat`, `polls`, `webinar`, `tab_sync`.

## Notifications Popup

It is possible to customize which activity needs to show a notification alert.
Use the `notifications` configuration to update individual category of
notifications.

All categories are enabled by default.

To disable specific category of notifications set the value of the category to
`false` like below.

```jsx live
const config = {
  notifications: {
    participant_left: false,
    chat: false,
    tab_sync: false,
  },
};

<DyteNotifications meeting={meeting} config={config} />;
```

## Notification duration

Similar to notification popup, it is possible to customize the duration of the
notification popup displayed on screen. By using the `notification_duration`
configuration, it is possible to change the duration for individual category of
notifications.

Here are the default display durations (in milliseconds)

    participant_joined: 2000
    participant_left: 2000
    participant_joined_waitlist: 4000
    chat: 2000
    polls: 2000
    webinar: 2000
    tab_sync: 2000

To change the duration for a specific category of notifications set the value of
the category to the milliseconds.

```jsx live
const config = {
  notification_duration: {
    participant_joined: 5000, // Show participant joined notification for 5 seconds
    participant_left: 1000, // Show participant left notification for 1 second only
    chat: 5000, // Show chat for 1 second only
    tab_sync: 1000, // Show tab sync changes for 1 second only
  },
};

<DyteNotifications meeting={meeting} config={config} />;
```

## Notification Sound

It is possible to turn off the notification sound for specific category of
notifications.

To disable sound for a specific category of notifications set the value of the
category to `false` like below.

```jsx live
const config = {
  notification_sounds: {
    participant_left: false,
    chat: false,
    polls: false,
  },
};

<DyteNotifications meeting={meeting} config={config} />;
```

## Controlling sound once participants count

It is possible to disable notification / sound automatically once the number of
participants cross a certain limit.

Turn off the notification sound for new chat messages after 10 participants

```jsx
const config = {
  participant_chat_message_sound_notification_limit: 10,
};
```

Turn off the notification sound for participant joined notifications after 10
participants

```jsx
const config = {
  participant_joined_sound_notification_limit: 10,
};
```

Currently the number of configurations are limited, we are adding it for more
categories soon.
