# Before You Start

Make sure to read this before you start integrating the UI Kit into your app.

These are a couple of components that are important for proper functioning of a
meeting.

### DyteParticipantsAudio

This component takes care of the audio playback and autoplay issues.

:::danger Audio

The user will not hear audio without this component.

:::

```html
<dyte-participants-audio id="my-audio"></dyte-participants-audio>

<script>
  document.getElementById('my-audio').meeting = meeting;
</script>
```

This component will also show a dialog in case the browser throws an auto play
error, requiring user interaction to allow playing audio.

Here is more information on
[Autoplay policy in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/).

Other browsers have similar policy, with some minor differences.

### DyteNotifications

:::danger Notifications

The user will not be notified of important events such as network disconnection,
poor network without this component.

:::

```html
<dyte-notifications id="my-notifications"></dyte-notifications>

<script>
  // load meeting

  document.getElementById('my-notifications').meeting = meeting;
  document.getElementById('my-notifications').config = {
    // which notifications to show
    notifications: ['chat', 'participant_joined', 'participant_left'],
    // which notifications should have sounds
    notification_sounds: ['chat', 'participant_joined', 'participant_left'],
    // maximum number of participant joined sound notifications
    participant_joined_sound_notification_limit: 10,
    // maximum number of chat message sound notifications
    participant_chat_message_sound_notification_limit: 10,
  };
</script>
```
