It loads your preset and renders the UI based on it. With this component, you
don't have to handle all the states, dialogs and other smaller bits of managing
the application.

```html
<dyte-meeting mode="fill" style="height: 480px; width: 100%"></dyte-meeting>

<script>
  const el = document.getElementById('dyte-el');
  el.meeting = meeting;
</script>
