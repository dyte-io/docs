# Quickstart

Quickly get started with UI Kit, with just a few lines of code!

:::info Before Getting Started

Before you start integrating Dyte into your application, make sure you've read
the [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) post and completed the steps
in the [Integrate Dyte section](/getting-started#integrate-dyte).

:::

First you would need to setup your project with the provided hooks and the
`<DyteProvider />`.

```html
<body>
  <dyte-meeting id="my-meeting"></dyte-meeting>

  <script>
    const init = async () => {
      const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
        authToken: '',
        roomName: '',
        defaults: {
          audio: true,
          video: true,
        },
      });

      document.getElementById('my-meeting').meeting = meeting;
    };

    init();
  </script>
</body>
```

:::tip

Try adding `show-setup-screen="true"` prop on `<dyte-meeting />` to enable the
Setup Screen.
