# Room Metadata

All metadata pertaining to a meeting is stored in `meeting.meta`. This includes:

- `viewType`: Indicates the type of the meeting, possible values are `WEBINAR`,
  `GROUP_CALL`, `LIVESTREAM`.
- `roomType`: Indicates the meeting is a group-call or a webinar.
- `meetingTitle`: The title of the meeting.
- `meetingStartedTimestamp`: The timestamp when the meeting started.
- `socketConnected`: Boolean flag to show when the socket is connected.

For example, if you want to get the title of the meeting the current participant
is connected to, you can do so by doing:

```ts
// Destructuring the metadata to get meetingTitle and joined
const { meetingTitle } = meeting.meta;

if (meeting.self.roomJoined) {
  console.log(
    `The local user has joined a meeting with title ${meetingTitle}.`
  );
}
```

The `meta` object also emits events for indicating the change in the connection
state of the room. For example, you can listen for the `connected` event to know
when the local user has successfully joined the room, and for the `disconnected`
event to find out if the local user's connection has dropped.

```ts
meeting.meta.on('connected', () => {
  console.log(
    `The local user has successfully joined the meeting ${meeting.meta.meetingTitle}`
  );
});

meeting.meta.on('disconnected', () => {
  console.log(
    `The local user got disconnected from the meeting ${meeting.meta.meetingTitle}`
  );
});

meeting.meta.on('poorConnection', () => {
  console.log(`The local user has poor network connection.`);
});

meeting.meta.on('connectionError', ({ reason }) => {
  console.log(`Could not connect to the room.`);
});
```
