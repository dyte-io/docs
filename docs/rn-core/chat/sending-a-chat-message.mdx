# Sending a chat message

As mentioned in [introduction](./introduction), there are 3 types of chat
messages - text messages, images, and files. There is a method in `meeting.chat`
to send a message of each type.

## Send a text message

To send a text message, the `meeting.chat.sendTextMessage()` method can be used.
This accepts a string `message` and sends it to the room.

```ts
const message = 'Is this the real life?';
await meeting.chat.sendTextMessage(message);
```

## Send an image

You can send an image with the help of `meeting.chat.sendImageMessage()`. This
accepts an image of type `File`, and sends it to the participants in the
meeting.

```ts
async function onSendImage() {
  // Get the image uri and create an object with the following fields
  const res = await DocumentPicker.pickSingle({
    type: [DocumentPicker.types.images],
  });
  const image = {
    uri: res.uri,
    name: res.name,
    size: res.size,
    type: res.type,
  };
  await meeting.chat.sendImageMessage(image);
}
```

## Send a file

Sending a file is quite similar to sending an image. The only difference is that
when you send an image, a preview will be shown in the meeting chat, which is
not the case for sending files. That being said, an image can be sent as a file
too using `meeting.chat.sendFileMessage()`.

```ts
async function onSendFile() {
  // Get the file uri and create an object with the following fields
  const res = await DocumentPicker.pickSingle({
    type: [DocumentPicker.types.allFiles],
  });
  const file = {
    uri: res.uri,
    name: res.name,
    size: res.size,
    type: res.type,
  };
  await meeting.chat.sendFileMessage(file);
}
```

## Extra

There is also a common method called `meeting.chat.sendMessage()` that can be
used to send any of the 3 types of messages displayed above. It essentially
calls one of the methods from above depending upon the type of payload you send
to the method. The `sendMessage()` method accepts a parameter `message` of the
following type:

```ts
async function sendMessage(
    message: { type: 'text', message: string }
        | { type: 'image', image: File }
        | { type: 'file', file: File },
) {...}
```

Here's how you would use the `sendMessage()` method to send a text message.

```ts
const message = 'Is this just fantasy?';
await meeting.chat.sendMessage({ type: 'text', message });
```
