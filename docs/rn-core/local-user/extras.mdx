## Pinning & unpinning

You can pin or unpin yourself given you have the appropriate permissions. You
can check the pinned status of the local user using `meeting.isPinned`.

```ts
meeting.self.pin();
```

```ts
meeting.self.unpin();
```

The Dyte Webinar revolves around the concept of a stage. The stage is directly
accessible for hosts, while participants can request to join the stage. Here's
