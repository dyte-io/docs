### Steps to publish

1. If you're using a JavaScript library or framework, you'll need to create a
   build first. If not you can skip this step.

```
npm run build
```

2. Copy `dyte-config.json` into the folder which contains `index.html`. If
   you're using a Javascript library or framework, this would be your build
   folder.

3. Move to the build folder and run the publish command.

```shell
cd ./build
```

```shell
dyte plugins publish
```

4.  you can use the `-l` flag if you wish to only publish the plugin and not
    deploy it.

```shell
dyte plugins publish -l
```
