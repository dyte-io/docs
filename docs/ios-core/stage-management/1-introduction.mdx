_Below documentation is relevant for Interactive Livestream(LHLS) and Webinar(WebRTC) use cases._

Instead of a traditional publish-subscribe model, where a user can publish their media and others can choose to subscribe, Dyte
comes with an optional managed configuration. In this managed configuration, a less privileged user can be configured with a
default behavior to not publish media. The user can then request permission to publish their media, which a privileged user can
choose to grant or deny.

### Accessing the Stage APIs

Dyte's stage management APIs allow users to perform actions such as joining and leaving the stage, managing stage requests and
permissions, and kicking participants from the stage. These APIs are accessible through the `meeting.stage` object.

### Stage Status

In meetings where stage management is enabled, a user's stage status can change within the values represented by the `StageStatus`
enum. These status values include:

- `ON_STAGE`: Indicates that the user is currently on the stage and is allowed to publish media.
- `OFF_STAGE`: Indicates that the user is a viewer and is not on the stage. They can see and listen to those on stage.
- `REQUESTED_TO_JOIN_STAGE`: Indicates that the user has a pending request to join the stage. This status is assigned to the user
  until the host accepts or rejects their request.
- `ACCEPTED_TO_JOIN_STAGE`: Indicates that the host has accepted the user's request to join the stage.
- `REJECTED_TO_JOIN_STAGE`: Indicates that the host has rejected the user's request to join the stage. The user can request again
  to join from this status.

The `meeting.stage.stageStatus` property provides the current stage status of the local user.

### Viewers

You can retrieve a list of off-stage participants (viewers) in a stage-enabled meeting by accessing the `meeting.stage.viewers`
property. This property provides a list of `DyteRemoteParticipant` objects whose stage status is not `ON_STAGE`.

### Joining the Stage

To interact with peers and publish media, users can join the stage. This action is only possible if the user's preset allows them
to publish media or if their request to join the stage has been accepted by a host (i.e., their stage status is `ACCEPTED_TO_JOIN_STAGE`).

```swift
meeting.stage.join()
```

### Leaving the Stage

When users want to stop interacting with peers, they can leave the stage. This action stops their media from being published,
and their audio and video are no longer received by others in the room.

```swift
meeting.stage.leave()
```

### List of Stage Events

The `DyteStageEventListener` interface provides callback methods for various stage events. Implement these callbacks to handle
stage-related events in your application:

```swift
extension WebinarViewModel: DyteStageEventListener {
    func onStageAccessRequestAccepted() {
        // Called when the local user is accepted to join the stage.
    }

    func onStageAccessRequestRejected() {
        // Called when the local user's request to join the stage is rejected by the host.
    }

    func onRemovedFromStage() {
        // Called when the local user is removed from the stage.
    }

    func onNewStageAccessRequest(participant: DyteRemoteParticipant) {
        // Called when a new stage access request is received from a participant.
        // Triggered only if the local user is a host.
    }

    func onStageAccessRequestsUpdated(participant: DyteJoinedMeetingParticipant) {
        // Called when a participant cancels their stage access request.
        // Triggered only if the local user is a host.
    }

    func onStageAccessRequestsUpdated(accessRequests: [DyteRemoteParticipant]) {
        // Called when the list of stage access requests is updated.
    }

    func onStageStatusUpdated(oldStatus: DyteiOSCore.StageStatus, newStatus: DyteiOSCore.StageStatus) {
        // Called when the local user's stage status is updated.
    }

    func onPeerStageStatusUpdated(participant: DyteRemoteParticipant, oldStatus: DyteiOSCore.StageStatus, newStatus: DyteiOSCore.StageStatus) {
        // Called when a remote participant's stage status is updated.
    }
}
```

All the stage management APIs return a `StageError` if the operation fails. On success, they return `null`. The error type can be one of the following:

- `StageDisabledForMeetingType`: The meeting type does not support stage management.
- `PermissionDenied`: The user does not have the required permissions to perform the operation.
- `ActionInvalidForStageStatus`: The operation is invalid for the current stage status.
- `NoRequestToCancel`: There is no pending request to cancel.

Next, we'll explore the Stage Management APIs for hosts, allowing them to manage stage requests, participants in Dyte meetings.
