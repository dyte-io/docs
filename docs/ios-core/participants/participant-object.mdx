# The participant object

The `participant` object consists of all the information related to a particular participant. For instance, it contains a participants video/audio/screenshare stream, and the participant's name. It also contains state variables that indicate whether a participant's camera is on or off, and whether they are muted or unmuted.

The participant object has the following properties.

- `id`: The `participantId` of the participant (aka `peerId`).
- `userId`: The `userId` of the participant.
- `name`: The participant's name.
- `picture`: The participant's picture (if any).
- `customParticipantId`: An arbitrary ID that can be set to identify the
  participant.
- `videoTrack`: The video track of the participant.
- `screenShareTrack`: The video and audio (if any) track of the participant's
  screen share stream.
- `videoEnabled`: Set to true if the participant's camera is on.
- `audioEnabled`: Set to true if the participant is unmuted.
- `isPinned`: True if current user is pinned in the meeting room.
- `presetName`: Name of the preset associated with the participant.
- `presetInfo` : A typed object representing the preset information for local user.
- `stageStatus`: Status of stage for the participant

## To get video view of a given participant

You can call `participant.getVideoView()` which will return a View which further
can used to add in any view.

Similarly one can use `participant.getScreenShareVideoView()` which will return a
View which further can used to add in any view.

## Host Controls

If you are the host of the room, you can use the **host controls**. The host controls allow you to manage the participants in the room.

The host controls include the following options:

- **Mute/Unmute**: Mute or unmute a participant.
- **Kick**: Kick a participant from the room.
- **Pin**: Pin a participant's video.
- **Turn off video**: Turn off a participant's video.

You can also use these methods from our participant object to
perform these actions programmatically.

```swift
if let participant = meeting.participants.joined.first(where: { $0.id == participantId }) {
    // To disable a participant's video stream
    participant.disableVideo()

    // To disable a participant's audio stream
    participant.disableAudio()

    // To kick a participant from the meeting
    participant.kick()
}
```

## Waiting Room

Host can use these waiting room methods from our participant object to
perform these actions programmatically.

```swift
// Accept the request and let the participant in the meeting
participant.acceptWaitListedRequest()

// Reject the request, do not permit the participant to join the meeting
participant.rejectWaitListedRequest()
```

## pin/unpin

You can also `pin` or `unpin` a participant in the meeting. All "pinned"
participants are added to the `meeting.participants.pinned`.

```swift
if let participant = meeting.participants.joined.first(where: { $0.id == participantId }) {
    // To pin a participant
    participant.pin()

    // To unpin a participant
    participant.unpin()
}
```

## Move between pages in paginated mode

The `setPage(pageNumber: Int)` method allows you to switch between pages of
participants present in the meeting.

```swift
// switch to 1st page
meeting.participants.setPage(1)
```

## Broadcast message to all participants

Send a broadcast message to all `joined` participants

_Parameters_:

`type`: A client-specific type to differentiate between custom messages like "emoji" or "greetings"

`payload`: A dictionary containing the message payload, where keys are strings and values are of any type.

```swift
// broadcast message
meeting.participants.broadcastMessage(type, payload)
```

# Receiving Broadcast messages

To be able to receive broadcast messages you need to implement a method
`onRoomMessage` method from callback `DyteSelfEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addChatEventsListener(dyteSelfEventsListener)`

[check this dyteSelfEventsListener broadcastMessage documentation](/ios-core/local-user/events#listen-to-broadcast-message-within-the-room)
