# Participant Types

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. These **does not** include the local user. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. For example, to get all the participants who joined the meeting:

```swift
// get all joined participants
var joined: [DyteRemoteParticipant] = meeting.participants.joined

// get all participants
var all: [DyteParticipant] = meeting.participants.all
```

The `meeting.participants` object has the following **lists** of participants

- **all**: A list that contains all the participants who have joined the meeting except the local user
- **joined**: A list that contains all the participants who are currently in the meeting
  except the local user
- **waitlisted**: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the
  meeting.
- **active**: A list that contains all the participants including the local user whose media is subscribed to i.e
  participants are supposed to be on the screen at the moment except the local user
- **pinned**: A list that contains all the pinned participants of the meeting.
- **screenShares**: A list that contains all the participants who are sharing their screen.

Therefore if you were to make a video / audio grid of participants, you'd use the `active` map, but to display the list of all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined` map.
