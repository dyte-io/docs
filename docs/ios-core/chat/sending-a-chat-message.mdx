# Sending a chat message

As mentioned in [introduction](./introduction), there are 3 types of chat
messages - text messages, images, and files. There is a method in `meeting.chat`
to send a message of each type.

## Send a text message

To send a text message, the `meeting.chat.sendTextMessage()` method can be used.
This accepts a string `message` and sends it to the room.

```swift
let message = "Is this the real life?"
meeting.chat.sendTextMessage(message: message)
```

## Send an image

You can send an image with the help of `meeting.chat.sendImageMessage()` and
sends it to the participants in the meeting.

```swift
let filePath = "file_path_of_image"
let fileName = "file_name"
meeting.chat.sendImageMessage(filePath: filePath, fileName: fileName)
```

## Send a file

Sending a file is quite similar to sending an image. The only difference is that
when you send an image, a preview will be shown in the meeting chat, which is
not the case for sending files. That being said, an image can be sent as a file
too using `meeting.chat.sendFileMessage()`.

```swift
let filePath = "file_path_of_image"
let fileName = "file_name"
meeting.chat.sendFileMessage(filePath: filePath, fileName: fileName)
```
