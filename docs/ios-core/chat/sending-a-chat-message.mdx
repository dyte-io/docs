# Sending a chat message

As mentioned in [introduction](./introduction), there are 3 types of chat messages - text messages, images, and files. There is a method in `meeting.chat` to send a message of each type.

## Send a text message

To send a text message, the `meeting.chat.sendTextMessage()` method can be used. This accepts a string `message` and sends it to the room.

```swift
var message = "Is this the real life?"
meeting.chat.sendTextMessage(message)
```

## Send an image

You can send an image with the help of `meeting.chat.sendImageMessage()` and
sends it to the participants in the meeting.

```swift
meeting.chat.meeting.chat.sendImageMessage(imageURL: url) { err in
  // Handle error if any
}
```

## Send a file

Sending a file is quite similar to sending an image. The only difference is that when you send an image, a preview will be shown in the meeting chat, which is not the case for sending files. That being said, an image can be sent as a file too using `meeting.chat.sendFileMessage()`.

```swift
meeting.chat.meeting.chat.sendFileMessage(fileURL: url) { err in
  // Handle error if any
}
```

## Chat Errors

The `sendTextMessage` method returns a `ChatTextError` if the operation fails, `null` if successful. The error can be the following:

- `PermissionDenied`: The user does not have permission to send a message.
- `MessageIsBlank`: The message is empty.
- `CharacterLimitExceeded`: The message exceeds the character limit. Default limit is 2000 characters.
- `RateLimitBreached`: The user has sent too many messages in a short period of time.

Both `sendImageMessage` and `sendFileMessage` methods accept a callback function that will be called with a `ChatFileError` if the operation is not successful, otherwise with `null` if successful.

Possible `ChatFileError`s are:

- `FileFormatNotAllowed`: The file format is not allowed.
- `PermissionDenied`: The user does not have permission to send a file.
- `RateLimitBreached`: The user has breached the rate limit for sending messages.
- `ReadFailed`: The file could not be read.
- `UploadFailed`: The file could not be uploaded.
