# Introducing chat

The meeting chat object is stored in `meeting.chat`, which has methods for
sending and receiving messages. There are 3 types of messages that can be sent
in chat - text messages, images, and files.

The `meeting.chat.messages` array contains all the messages that have been sent
in the chat. This is an array of objects, where each object is of type
`DyteChatMessage`.

We support three types of chat messages, they are as follows

- Text Message
- Image Message
- File Message

All above objects are of type `DyteChatMessage` along with their own class
variables.
