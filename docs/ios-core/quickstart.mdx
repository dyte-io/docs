# iOS Core SDK Quickstart

This quickstart shows how to use Dyte's iOS Core SDK to add live video and audio to your iOS applications.

To get started quickly, you can use our sample code. You can clone and run a sample application from the Android Core samples, available in both [Swift](https://github.com/dyte-io/ios-samples/tree/main/iOS-core) and [SwiftUI](https://github.com/dyte-io/ios-samples/tree/main/DyteSwiftUI-Core).

## Objective

You'll learn how to:

- [Install the Dyte SDK](#step-1-install-the-sdk)
- [Initialize the SDK](#step-2-initialize-the-sdk)
- [Configure a Dyte meeting](#step-3-set-the-properties-in-the-dytemeetinginfo-class)
- [Initialize the Dyte meeting](#step-4-initialize-the-connection-request)
- [Go live with your Dyte meeting!](#step-5-connect-to-the-meeting)

## Before Getting Started

- Make sure you've read the
  [Getting Started with Dyte](/getting-started) topic and
  completed the steps in the
  [Integrate Dyte](/getting-started#integrate-dyte) section.
  You must complete the following steps:
  - Create a [Dyte Developer Account](https://dev.dyte.io/)
  - Create a
    [Dyte Meeting](/api/?v=v2#/operations/create_meeting)
  - [Add Participant](/api/?v=v2#/operations/add_participant)
    to the meeting
- Install
  [Xcode](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwin55bqodH8AhUVQXwKHaR-DAsQFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fxcode%2Fid497799835%3Fmt%3D12&usg=AOvVaw2fEvMbfRtGhB4SPHYB54NX)
- Ensure that Rosetta is installed with Xcode on Mac computers with Apple
  silicon.
- Make sure your Mac computers are running macOS version 12.0 Monterey or
  higher.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

<Tabs groupId="build-android-core">
  <TabItem value="CocoaPods" label="CocoaPods" default>

1. Set your platform to iOS 13.0 or above in your Podfile.

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

2. Add 'DyteiOSCore' to your Podfile.

<CocoaPodInstallation pkg="DyteiOSCore" path="c/d/1/DyteiOSCore" />

3. Install the client SDK from pod.

```shell
pod install
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Swift Package Manager" label="Swift Package Manager">

Add `DyteiOSCore` SDK through Swift Package Manager in Xcode. Use https://github.com/dyte-in/DyteMobileCoreiOS.git as the package source.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

4. Add the following entries to the info.plist file. This gives permission to
   your app to access the camera and microphone, access photos, install the
   required fonts and icons.

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will use your Bluetooth to access your Bluetooth headphones.</string>
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will use your Bluetooth to access your Bluetooth headphones.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to see you during meetings, we need access to your camera.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to hear you during meetings, we need access to your microphone.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to share, we need access to your photos.</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
	<array>
		<string>audio</string>
		<string>voip</string>
		<string>fetch</string>
		<string>remote-notification</string>
	</array>
```

The `UIBackgroundModes` key is used in the `Info.plist` file of an iOS app to declare the app's supported background execution modes. This key is an array of strings that specifies the types of background tasks that the app supports. By declaring the background modes, the app can continue to run in the background and perform specific tasks even when it is not in the foreground.
It's important to note that the use of background modes should be justified and comply with Apple's App Store Review Guidelines. Apps that misuse background modes or unnecessarily run in the background may be rejected during the app review process.

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

1. The `DyteMobileClient` is the main class of the SDK. It is the main entry
   point of the SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order
   to use the SDK. To instantiate DyteMobileClient, you should use
   `DyteiOSClientBuilder().build()`.

```swift
let meeting = DyteiOSClientBuilder().build()
```

2. Add the required listeners and implement callback stubs as per requirement

```swift
meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(meetingRoomEventsListener: self)
meeting.addParticipantEventsListener(participantEventsListener: self)
meeting.addSelfEventsListener(selfEventsListener: self)
meeting.addParticipantEventsListener(participantEventsListener: self)
meeting.addChatEventsListener(chatEventsListener: self)
meeting.addPollEventsListener(pollEventsListener: self)
meeting.addRecordingEventsListener(recordingEventsListener: self)
meeting.addWaitlistEventListener(waitlistEventListener: self)
meeting.addLiveStreamEventsListener(liveStreamEventsListener: self)
```

## Step 3: Set the properties in the DyteMeetingInfo class

Add `authToken` that you got from the REST API to constructor of DyteMeetingInfoV2 - [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/addParticipant)

| Name          | Description |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authToken`   | After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](/api?v=v2#/operations/add_participant) The API response contains the `authToken`. |     
| `enableAudio` | Set whether to join the meeting with your Mic ON or OFF by passing `true` or `false`.|     
| `enableVideo` | Set whether to join the meeting with your Camera ON or OFF by passing `true` or `false`.|     
| `baseUrl`     | Base URL of the dyte's enviorment you have created the meeting on. |     

```swift
let meetingInfo = DyteMeetingInfoV2(authToken: authToken,
                                  enableAudio: true,
                                  enableVideo: true,
                                  baseUrl: "dyte.io")
```

## Step 4: Initialize the connection request

To initialize the connection request, call the `doInit()` method obtained on
`meeting` with the `meetingInfo` argument. This will establish the connection
with the Dyte meeting server.

```swift
meeting.doInit(dyteMeetingInfo_: meetingInfo)
```

Note: This is the asynchronous method, You will have to attached observer (meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(meetingRoomEventsListener: self)
) to know its completion state, success or failure, Listen to below callbacks of 'DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener'.

```swift
func onMeetingInitCompleted() {
 }

func onMeetingInitFailed(exception: KotlinException) {
 }
```

OR

```swift
meeting.doInit(dyteMeetingInfo: DyteMeetingInfoV2,
                       onInitCompleted: () -> Void,
                       onInitFailed_: () -> Void)
```

To initialize the connection request, call the `doInit` method
which is asynchronous and callback based.

## Step 5: Connect to the meeting

Now, you have established the connection with the Dyte meeting server
successfully. Once `onMeetingInitCompleted()` is triggered, next step is to join
the room.

### Join the room

To join the meeting room, do the following only after you received the doInit completion callbacks.

```swift
func onMeetingInitCompleted() {
   meeting.joinRoom()
 }
```

Or

```swift
 meeting.doInit(dyteMeetingInfo: meetingInfo) {
            self.meeting.joinRoom {
                print("Room Joined successfully")
            } onRoomJoinFailed: {
                print("Room Joined failed")
            }
        } onInitFailed_: {
            print("Meeting Initialisation got failed")
        }
```

Join room event listeners: Once you call `joinRoom()`, you can listen to
callbacks for this action on meeting object if you have done
`meeting.addSelfEventsListener(selfEventsListener: self)`.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
  func onMeetingRoomJoinStarted() {
    // meeting join started
  }

  func onMeetingRoomJoined() {
    // meeting room joined successfully
  }

  func onMeetingRoomJoinFailed(exception: KotlinException) {
    // error in joining meeting room.
  }
}
```

### Leave the room

Once the meeting is over, you can leave the meeting room. To leave the meeting
call `leaveRoom()` on `meeting` object.

```swift
meeting.leaveRoom()
```

Leave room event listeners: You can listen to `leaveRoom()` callbacks by
registering obsever on meeting object as follows:

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
  func onMeetingRoomLeaveStarted() {
    // meeting room leave started
  }

  func onMeetingRoomLeft() {
    // meeting room leave completed
  }
}
```
