# Meeting Metadata

### Change the name of the user

You can allow the user to edit their name by using the `setDisplayName` method.

```swift
meeting.localUser.setDisplayName("New Name")
```

**Note**: The name change will only be reflected to other participants if this method is called before joining the room.
