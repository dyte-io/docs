# Voting on a poll

The `meeting.polls.vote()` method can be used to register a vote on a poll. It
accepts the following params.

| Param       | Type            | Default Value | Required | Description                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| pollMessage | DytePollMessage | -             | yes      | The poll message to vote on. |
| pollOption  | DytePollOption  | -             | yes      | The option to vote for.      |

meeting.
