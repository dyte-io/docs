# Room Metadata

All metadata pertaining to a meeting is stored in `meeting.meta`. This includes:

- `roomName`: The name of the room the current participant is connected to.
- `roomType`: Indicates the meeting is a group-call or a webinar.
- `meetingTitle`: The title of the meeting.
- `meetingStartedTimestamp`: The timestamp when the meeting started.

For example, if you want to get the name of the room the current participant is
connected to, you can do so by doing:

```swift
let roomName = meeting.meta.roomName

if meeting.localUser.roomJoined {
    print("The local user has joined room \(roomName).")
}
```
