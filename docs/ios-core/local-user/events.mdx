# Local User - Events

You can subscribe to various events on the local user by implementing `DyteSelfEventsListener` and
passing the object to `meeting.addSelfEventsListener(dyteSelfEventsListener)`.

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts/stops the video using `enableVideo()` or
`disableVideo()`.

```kotlin
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onVideoUpdate(videoEnabled: Bool) {
      if (videoEnabled) {
        // video is enabled, and other participants in room can see local user
      } else {
        // video is disabled, and other participants in room can not see local user.
      }
    }
}
```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts/stops the audio using `enableAudio()` or
`disableAudio()`.

```swift

extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onAudioUpdate(audioEnabled: Bool) {
      if (audioEnabled) {
        // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
      } else {
        // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
      }
    }
}
```

### Proximity changed

Triggered when there is any change in proximity. Meaning if device is near ear
piece which triggers display on/off.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onProximityChanged(isNear: Bool) {
      // if `isNear` is true, display should be turned off, as user might be speaking through earpiece
      // if false, display should be turned on, as user might be looking at display and listening through speaker/earphones.
    }
}
```

### Waitlist status

For meetings whose waiting room is enabled:

To get status of localUser in waiting room we can use

```swift
let waitListStatus = meeting.localUser.waitListStatus
```

Developers can listen to those changes in `onWaitListStatusUpdate()` callbacks

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onWaitListStatusUpdate(waitListStatus: WaitListStatus) {
      // handle waitlist status here
    }
}
```

### Process message within a room

Manage messages among participants within a room.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onRoomMessage(type: String, payload: [String : Any]) {
      // handle the message here
    }
}
```

### Screenshare callbacks for local user

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onScreenShareStartFailed(reason: String) {
      // screenshare failed to start
    }

    func onScreenShareStarted() {
      // screenshare started presenting in the meeting
    }

    func onScreenShareStopped() {
      // screenshared stopped by the local user
    }
}
```

### Device permission callbacks once local user is joined in the meeting

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutCameraPermission() {
      // local user joined without camera permission
    }

    func onMeetingRoomJoinedWithoutMicPermission() {
      // local user joined without microphone permission
    }
}
```

### When local user is kicked out from the meeting by a remote user

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DyteSelfEventsListener {
    func onRemovedFromMeeting() {
        // removed from meeting
      }
}
```
