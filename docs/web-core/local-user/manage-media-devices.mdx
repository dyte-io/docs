# Manage Media Devices

To get the list of media devices that are currently being used, you can
use the following methods:

```js
// Get all media devices
const devices = await meeting.self.getAllDevices();

// Get all audio devices
const audioDevices = await meeting.self.getAudioDevices();

// Get all video devices
const videoDevices = await meeting.self.getVideoDevices();

// Get all speakers
const speakerDevices = await meeting.self.getSpeakerDevices();

// Get device by ID
const device = await meeting.self.getDeviceById('12345', 'audio');

// Fetch current media devices being used
const currentDevices = meeting.self.getCurrentDevices();
```

## Set device

To set a device as an active device, you can call `setDevice` method. This takes
a `MediaDeviceInfo` object, and replaces the same `kind` device.

```js
await meeting.self.setDevice(device);
```
