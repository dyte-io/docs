# Manage Media Devices

Media devices represents the hardware for the camera, microphone and speaker
devices. To get the list of media devices that are currently being used, you can
use the following methods:

```js
// Get all media devices
const devices = meeting.self.getAllDevices();

// Get all audio devices
const audioDevices = meeting.self.getAudioDevices();

// Get all video devices
const videoDevices = meeting.self.getVideoDevices();

// Get all speakers
const speakerDevices = meeting.self.getSpeakerDevices();

// Get device by ID
const device = meeting.self.getDeviceById('12345', 'audio');

// Fetch current media devices being used
const currentDevices = meeting.self.getCurrentDevices();
```

## Set device

To set a device as an active device, you can call `setDevice` method. This takes
a `MediaDeviceInfo` object, and replaces the same `kind` device.

```js
meeting.self.setDevice(device);
```
