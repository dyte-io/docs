# Introducing chat

The meeting chat object is stored in `meeting.chat`, which has methods for
sending and receiving messages. There are 3 types of messages that can be sent
in chat - text messages, images, and files.

The `meeting.chat.messages` array contains all the messages that have been sent
in the chat. This is an array of objects, where each object is of type
`Message`.

The type `Message` is defined in the following manner.

```ts
interface BaseMessage<T extends MessageType> {
  type: T;
  userId: string;
  displayName: string;
  time: Date;
  id: string;
  read?: boolean;
  pluginId?: string;
  pinned?: boolean;
}

interface TextMessage extends BaseMessage<MessageType.text> {
  message: string;
}

interface ImageMessage extends BaseMessage<MessageType.image> {
  link: string;
}

interface FileMessage extends BaseMessage<MessageType.file> {
  name: string;
  size: number;
  link: string;
}

type Message = TextMessage | ImageMessage | FileMessage;
```
