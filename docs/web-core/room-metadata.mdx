# Room Metadata

All metadata pertaining to a meeting is stored in `meeting.meta`. This includes:

- `roomName`: The name of the room the current participant is connected to.
- `roomType`: Indicates the meeting is a group-call or a webinar.
- `meetingTitle`: The title of the meeting.
- `meetingStartedTimestamp`: The timestamp when the meeting started.

For example, if you want to get the name of the room the current participant is
connected to, you can do so by doing:

```ts
// Destructuring the metadata to get roomName and joined
const { roomName } = meeting.meta;

if (meeting.self.roomJoined) {
  console.log(`The local user has joined room ${roomName}.`);
}
```

The `meta` object also emits for indicating the change in the connection state
of the room. For example, you can listen for the `connected` event to know when
the local user has successfully joined the room, and for the `disconnected`
event to find out if the local user's connection has dropped.

```ts
meeting.meta.on('connected', () => {
  console.log(
    `The local user has successfully joined the room ${meeting.meta.roomName}`
  );
});

meeting.meta.on('disconnected', () => {
  console.log(
    `The local user got disconnected from the room ${meeting.meta.roomName}`
  );
});

meeting.meta.on('poorConnection', () => {
  console.log(`The local user has poor network connection.`);
});

meeting.meta.on('connectionError', ({ reason }) => {
  console.log(`Could not connect to the room.`);
});
```
