# The participant object

The `participant` object consists of all the information related to a particular
participant. For instance, it contains a participants video/audio/screenshare
stream, and the participant's name. It also contains state variables that
indicate whether a participant's camera is on or off, and whether they are muted
or unmuted. Head over to [DyteParticipant](../reference/DyteParticipant.md) for
a detailed reference.

The participant object has the following properties.

- `id`: The `participantId` of the participant (aka `peerId`).
- `userId`: The `userId` of the participant.
- `name`: The participant's name.
- `picture`: The participant's picture (if any).
- `clientSpecificId`: An arbitrary ID that can be set to identify the
  participant.
- `device`: Information about the device used by the participant.
- `videoTrack`: The video track of the participant.
- `audioTrack`: The audio track of the participant.
- `screenShareTracks`: The video and audio (if any) track of the participant's
  screen share stream.
- `videoEnabled`: Set to true if the participant's camera is on.
- `audioEnabled`: Set to true if the participant is unmuted.
- `screenShareEnabled`: Set to true if the participant is sharing their screen.
- `supportsRemoteControl`: Set to true if the participant is using an SDK that
  supports remote control.
- `isPinned`: Set to true if the participant is pinned.
- `presetName`: Name of the preset associated with the participant.
- `webinarStageStatus`: Represents the participants current webinar status.

The participant object is an event emitter, so you can set listeners on this
object for events such as video and audio updates. For instance, to fire a
callback when a participant toggles their mic, you can subscribe to the
following events.

```ts
meeting.participants.joined
  .get(participantId)
  .on('audioUpdate', ({ audioEnabled, audioTrack }) => {
    // This will only be fired on mic toggles for the participant with ID `participantId`
    console.log(
      'The participant with id',
      participantId,
      'has toggled their mic to',
      audioEnabled
    );
  });
```

The events emitted by all participant objects are also re-emitted by all the
maps in `meeting.participants`. Therefore, you can add a listener to
`meeting.participants.joined` for the `audioUpdate` event. For instance, the
same code above can be re-implemented as follows.

```ts
meeting.participants.joined.on(
  'audioUpdate',
  (participant, { audioEnabled, audioTrack }) => {
    // This will be fired on mic toggles for all participants in the meeting
    console.log(
      'The participant with id',
      participant.id,
      'has toggled their mic to',
      audioEnabled
    );
  }
);
```

Read more about the participant events in the
[events](/web-core/participants/events) section in the API reference.

## Host controls methods

If you (the local user) have the relevant permissions in the meeting, you can
disable a participant's video/audio streams, or even remove them from the
meeting.

```ts
const participant = meeting.participants.joined.get(participantId);

// To disable a participant's video stream
participant.disableVideo();

// To disable a participant's audio stream
participant.disableAudio();

// To kick a participant from the meeting
participant.kick();
```

You can also `pin` or `unpin` a participant in the meeting. All "pinned"
participants are added to the `meeting.participants.pinned` map.

```ts
const participant = meeting.participants.joined.get(participantId);

// Pin a participant to the meeting.
await participant.pin();

// Unpin a participant in the meeting.
await participant.unpin();
```

## Webinar methods

The host can accept a user's request to join the webinar using
`acceptJoinStageRequest()`.

```ts
meeting.participants.joined.on('peerRequestToJoinStage', (p) => {
  const participant = meeting.participants.joined.get(p.id);
  await participant.acceptJoinStageRequest();
});
```

The host can reject a user's request to join the webinar using
`rejectRequestToJoinStage()`.

```ts
meeting.participants.joined.on('peerRequestToJoinStage', (p) => {
  const participant = meeting.participants.joined.get(p.id);
  await participant.rejectRequestToJoinStage();
});
```

The host has the option of removing a user from the webinar. It can be done
using the `removeFromStage()` method.

```ts
const participant = meeting.participants.joined.get(participantId);
await participant.removeFromStage();
```
