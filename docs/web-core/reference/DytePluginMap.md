<a name="module_DytePluginMap"></a>

This is a map of plugins, indexed by `plugin.id`. This map emits an event
whenever a plugin present in the map emits an event. For example, when a plugin
is added to this map, a `pluginAdded` event is emitted from the map. When a
plugin object emits an event `stateUpdate`, the map re-emits that event
(provided the plugin is present in the map).
