<a name="module_DyteParticipantMap"></a>

This is a map of participants, indexed by `participant.id` (a participant's peer
ID). This map emits an event whenever a participant present in the map emits an
event. For example, when a participant is added to this map, a
`participantJoined` event is emitted from the map. When a participant object
emits an event `videoUpdate`, the map re-emits that event (provided the
participant is present in the map).
