# Other poll functions

## View poll results

**The total votes on a poll can be accessed in the following manner.**

```ts
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const votes = poll.voted;
```

`votes` is an array of participant ID's (`meeting.participant.id`).

**The total votes on a poll option can be accessed in the following manner.**

```ts
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const options = poll.options;
```

`options` returns an array of objects, where each object is of type
[`PollObject`](./introduction).

## Get notified when a new poll is created

An event is fired each time `meeting.polls.items` is updated. User can listen
for this to get the updated list of polls.

```ts
meeting.polls.on('pollsUpdate', ({ polls }) => {
  console.log(polls);
});
```
