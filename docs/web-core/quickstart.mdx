# Quickstart

The DyteClient is the root class of the SDK. It is the main entry point of the
SDK. It is the only class that you need to instantiate in order to use the SDK.
To instantiate DyteClient, you can run the following command:

```js
const meeting = await DyteClient.init({
  roomName,
  authToken,
});
await meeting.joinRoom();
```

You can get the roomName and authToken using our backend APIs and then pass it
to the init method of DyteClient.

:::info

Once join room process completes `roomJoined` event is emitted on `meeting.self`
namespace. If you want to take any actions like enabling audio, video or start
and stop recording etc. it should be done after the `roomJoined` event is fired.

For example:

    meeting.self.on('roomJoined', () => {
        console.log('User has joined the room', meeting.self.roomJoined);
        // run my actions.
    });

    await meeting.joinRoom();

:::

### Leave room

Leave the meeting room.

```js
await meeting.leaveRoom();
```
