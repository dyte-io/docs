title: Prebuilt Create Poll Screen
---

In Dyte meetings, participants can create polls to gather opinions or make decisions collectively.
The ability to create polls is determined by the [polls permissions](/guides/livestream/advanced/configuring-permissions#polls)
set in the participant's preset.

## Using Dyte's Create Poll Screen

Dyte's Android UI Kit provides a user-friendly prebuilt screen, [DyteCreatePollBottomSheet](/android/components/dyte-poll-form),
for creating polls in a Dyte meeting. When using the DyteCreatePollBottomSheet, the poll creator can:

- Add more options to the poll (default is 2)
- Choose to make the poll voting anonymous
- Choose to hide the poll results before voting, keeping the vote count and voters hidden from participants

To integrate the `DyteCreatePollBottomSheet` into your app and allow participants to create polls,
use the provided code snippet:

```kotlin
import dyte.io.uikit.screens.polls.DyteCreatePollBottomSheet

val createPollBottomSheet = DyteCreatePollBottomSheet()
createPollBottomSheet.show(childFragmentManager, TAG)
```

**Wrap Up**: With Dyte's prebuilt Create Poll screen, you can easily add interactive polls features
to your app, enhancing participant engagement in Dyte meetings.
