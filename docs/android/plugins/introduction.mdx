# Introduction

Plugins are one-click add-ons that can make your meetings more immersive and collaborative. Dyte provides a bunch of inbuilt plugins to choose from, you can also build your own plugins using the [Plugin SDK](../../plugin-sdk/).

The meeting plugins can be accessed from the `meeting.plugins` object, it exposes the following.

| Property | Type | Description                            |
| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| active   | List | All plugins that are currently in use. |
| all      | List | All plugins the meeting has access to. |

Each plugin in the list is of type `DytePlugin` which has the following public fields and methods:

```kotlin
class DytePlugin {
    val id: String
    val name: String
    val description: String
    val picture: String
    val isPrivate: Boolean
    val staggered: Boolean
    val baseURL: String
    val config: PluginConfig
    val isActive: Boolean
    val enabledBy: String?

    fun activate()
    fun deactivate()
    fun getPluginView(): WebView
    fun uploadFile(file: DytePluginFile)
    fun sendData(eventName: String, data: Any?)
}
```
