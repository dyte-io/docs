There are two ways you can track what state a recording is in or view more
details about a recording:

## Using the `recording.statusUpdate` Webhook (Recommended)

Dyte sends out a `recording.statusUpdate` webhook each time the recording
transitions between states during its lifecycle. To learn more on what payloads
are sent along with each state, and how to configure webhooks, see
[`recording.statusUpdate`](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events#recordingstatusupdate).

## By polling Recording APIs

Alternatively, you can also use the following APIs:

- [Fetch all recordings for an organization](/api/?v=v2#/operations/get_all_recordings):
  This endpoint gets all past, and ongoing recordings linked to a meeting.
- [Fetch active recording](/api/?v=v2#/operations/get_active_recording): This
  endpoint gets all ongoing recordings of a meeting.
- [Fetch details of a recording](/api/?v=v2#/operations/get_one_recording): This
  endpoint gets a specific recording using a recording ID.
