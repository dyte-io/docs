# Webhooks Overview

Webhooks are
[HTTP-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) callback
functions that can be defined by the user to allow lightweight, event-driven
communication between two APIs.

Setting up a webhook involves the following steps:

1. The client provides a unique URL to the server API and specifies which event
   it wanted to be notified about.
2. Once the webhook is configured, the server automatically sends the relevant
   payload to the client's webhook URL when the specified event occurs.

Dyte uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens. Webhooks
are particularly useful for asynchronous events, such as when a recording is
uploaded or when a participant joins your meeting.

## How does Dyte use Webhooks?

A webhook enables Dyte to push real-time updates to your applications. When the
event occurs, Dyte makes an HTTP request (usually a POST) to the URL you
configured for the webhook and sends the updates to your application as a JSON
payload. You can then use these events to perform actions in your backend
systems. To learn more, see Dyte webhook events overview.

Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events, such as when a
recording is uploaded or when a participant joins the meeting.

Let’s say you have a meeting that you want to record. You have registered to
receive the `meeting.started` and `meeting.ended` event. A webhook notifies your
app when the meeting starts and when it ends. After your webhook endpoint
receives the meeting.started event, your webhook function can then run backend
actions to start recording the meeting and end the recording of the meeting when
`meeting.ended` event is received.

## Anatomy of a Webhook

A webhook HTTP request generally consists of the following:

- Header
- Payload

### Header

For each event that triggers the webhook, a header is included to describe the event. The header provides information about the request, such as content type, webhook ID, UUID, signature details, and so on.

  height="300"
  alt="webhook-id"
  className="webhook-id-use"
/>

The following headers are of more importance for your security and reliability:

| **Header**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dyte-webhook-id` | Webhook IDs are used to uniquely identify a specific webhook endpoint or events. See [Verify using webhook IDs](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/signatures#verify-using-webhook-ids).                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `dyte-uuid`       | This is a unique UUID identifying the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `dyte-signature`  | Dyte verifies the webhook events it sends to your endpoints by including a signature in the dyte-signature header of each event. This allows you to confirm that the event came from Dyte and not a malicious server impersonating Dyte. See [Verify Webhooks Using Dyte's Signature](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/signatures#verify-using-dytes-signature). |

### Payload

Payload contains information about the event that triggered the webhook, such as user data or a change in state.

For example,

```json
{
  "event": "livestreaming.statusUpdate",
  "streamId": "d231d346-c422-43a6-a324-c0d65b79c8a7",
  "status": "OFFLINE"
}
```
