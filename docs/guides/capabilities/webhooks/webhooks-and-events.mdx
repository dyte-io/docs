# Set Up Webhooks to Receive Real-time Updates

This topic explains how to set up webhooks to receive real-time updates for
specific events. Refer
[View Webhook Events List](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events) to view the list of
events for which notifications can be sent. Setting up a webhook to start
receiving notifications in your application involves the following steps:

1. Identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads you want to
   parse.
2. Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your backend
   application. Creating a webhook endpoint is no different from creating any
   other API route on your backend. It's an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint on your
   server with a URL. You can use a single endpoint to handle multiple event
   types at once, or you can set up individual endpoints for specific events.
3. Handle requests from Dyte by parsing each event object and returning 2xx
   response status codes.
4. Deploy your webhook endpoint so it’s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
5. Register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL using the Dyte
   [developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io) or Webhook APIs.

### Step 1: Identify the events to monitor

Use the [events overview guide](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events) to identify the
events your webhook endpoint needs to parse.

### Step 2: Create a webhook endpoint

Set up an HTTP endpoint that can accept webhook requests with a POST method. For
example, this route in express is a map to a Node.js webhook function.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const event = request.body;
  // ... do further processing
});
```

### Step 3: Handle requests from Dyte

Your endpoint must be configured to receive events for the type of event
notifications you want to receive. Dyte sends events to your webhook endpoint as
part of a POST request with a JSON payload.

#### Register your Endpoint

You can register your endpoint as a webhook and listen for specific events using
our [dev portal](https://dev.dyte.io) or by making an API request. For example,
to receive all events, you can make a request like:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dyte.io/v2/webhooks' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic WRiOmQyNzBmYjJmOGNiNGUzZWY1MGI1' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "All events webhook",
    "url": "<your endpoint here>",
    "events": [
        "meeting.started",
        "meeting.ended",
        "meeting.participantJoined",
        "meeting.participantLeft",
        "recording.statusUpdate",
        "livestreaming.statusUpdate"
    ]
}'
```

For more information, check out the
[webhooks API reference](/api/?v=v2#/operations/addWebhook).

#### Check for `dyte-uuid` Header

Each webhook will have a unique value for the `dyte-uuid` header. You can use
these to ensure you don't process any retries.

#### Return a `2xx` Response

Your endpoint must quickly (within 3 seconds) return a successful status code (`2xx`) prior to any
complex logic that could cause a timeout.

```js
app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const event = request.body;
  // ... do further processing
  res.status(200).send();
  // ... perform heavy tasks
  return;
});
```

#### Built-in Retries

Dyte webhooks have built-in retry methods for `3xx`, `4xx` or `5xx` response
status codes. If Dyte doesn't receive a `2xx` response status code for an event within 3 seconds,
we mark the event as failed and retry up to 5 times.

### Step 4: Secure your webhooks (recommended)

Use [webhook signatures](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/signatures) to verify that Dyte
generated a webhook request and that it didn't come from a malicious server
pretending to be Dyte.

#### Sample code

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="node" label="Node.js">

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  // verify signature
  // ...

  // parse event body
  switch (req.body.event) {
    case 'meeting.participantJoined':
      const { meeting, participant } = req.body;
      // Then define and call a method to handle the joined participant
      // handleParticipantJoined(meeting, participant);
      break;
    case 'recording.statusUpdate':
      const { meeting, recording } = req.body;
      // Then define and call a method to handle the recording status update
      // handleRecordingUpdate(meeting, recording);
      break;
    // ... handle other event types
    default:
      console.log(`Unhandled event type ${event.type}`);
  }
});

app.listen(8000, () => console.log('Running on port 8000'));
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Step 5: Register your HTTPS URL

Register your publicly accessible HTTPS URL using the
[Dyte developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io) or
[Webhook APIs](/api/?v=v2#/operations/addWebhook).
