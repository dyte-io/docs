# Set Up Webhooks to Receive Real-time Updates

Webhooks let you receive real-time updates when specific events occur in Dyte. They enable your backend to respond immediately—for example, when a participant joins a meeting or when a recording status changes.

To set up webhooks, follow these five steps:

1. Identify which events you want to monitor.
2. Create a webhook endpoint in your backend.
3. Handle incoming webhook requests and respond correctly.
4. Secure your webhook with signature verification.
5. Register your endpoint using [Dyte's developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io) or API.

## Step 1: Choose the Events to Monitor

Start by identifying which Dyte events are relevant for your application. For a complete list, see the [webhook events guide](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events).

---

## Step 2: Create a Webhook Endpoint

Set up a POST endpoint in your backend server to accept webhook events from Dyte. Here’s an example using Express in Node.js:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  // Handle event
  res.status(200).send('Event received');
});
```

You can use a single endpoint for all events or set up separate routes for each event type.

If you want to test your endpoint before registering it with Dyte, use tools like [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/) or [Typed Webhook](https://typedwebhook.tools/) to inspect payloads and debug easily.

---

## Step 3: Handle Events and Return a `2xx` Response

When Dyte sends a webhook event, it expects your endpoint to:

- Parse the JSON payload
- Respond with a 2xx status code within 3 seconds

Example:

```js
app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;

  // Process the event here

  res.status(200).send();
});
```

If your endpoint takes longer than 3 seconds or returns a `3xx`, `4xx`, or `5xx` response, Dyte retries the request up to five times.

### `dyte-uuid` Header

Every webhook request from Dyte includes a `dyte-uuid` header. You can use this to avoid processing the same event more than once.

### Register the Webhook

You can register your endpoint through the [developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io) or use the API:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.dyte.io/v2/webhooks' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <api_authorization_token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "name": "All events webhook",
  "url": "<your endpoint here>",
  "events": [
    "meeting.started",
    "meeting.ended",
    "meeting.participantJoined",
    "meeting.participantLeft",
    "recording.statusUpdate",
    "livestreaming.statusUpdate"
  ]
}'
```

For more info, see the [Webhook API reference](/api/?v=v2#/operations/addWebhook).

---

## Step 4: Secure Your Webhooks (Recommended)

To ensure that requests are genuinely from Dyte, validate the webhook signature. Learn more in the [webhook signature guide](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/signatures).

Example Node.js implementation:

```js
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();

app.post('/webhook', express.json({ type: 'application/json' }), (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-dyte-signature'];
  const secret = process.env.DYTE_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(req.body))
    .digest('hex');

  if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  const event = req.body;
  // Process event here

  res.status(200).send();
});
```

---

## Step 5: Register Your Endpoint

Once your endpoint is live and secured, register it using:

- The [Dyte developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io)
- The [Webhook API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/addWebhook)
