# Export Chat Dump of a Session

You can programmatically retrieve all chat messages of a Dyte session in the following ways:

- Using [Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat)
- Setting up webhook for the [meeting.chatSynced](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events#meetingchatsynced) event

This guide walks you through the steps involved in exporting chat dump of a session using Chat Replay API.

If you wish to use webhooks, see [Set Up Webhooks](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhooks-and-events) and [meeting.chatSynced](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events#meetingchatsynced).

:::info Note

Chat Replay API is not enabled by default for your organization.
[Contact us](https://dyte.io/contact) to enable the Chat Replay API for your
organization.

:::

Once [Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat) is enabled, do the
following:

1. Get the `chat_download_url` using
   [Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat).
2. Download the chat dump CSV file.

## Get `chat_download_url`

To get the `chat_download_url`, make a `HTTP GET` request to
[Chat Replay API](/api/?v=v2#/operations/GetSessionChat). The API returns the
following:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "chat_download_url": "string",
    "chat_download_url_expiry": "string"
  }
}
```

- The `chat_download_url` is a URL that allows you to download the entire chat dump of a session in CSV format from AWS S3.
- `chat_download_url_expiry` indicates the expiry timestamp of the `chat_download_url`. If the `chat_download_url` gets expired, simply call this endpoint again to obtain a new download URL.

## Download the chat dump file

You can download the chat dump file in CSV format by making `HTTP GET` request
to `chat_download_url` that you obtained in the previous step.

The process of downloading any file from a HTTP URL in JavaScript differs
slightly based on whether you are doing it on client side or server side.

### Download on the client

To download at client side, do the following:

1. Make a GET request to the `chat_download_url`.
2. Convert response to blob.
3. Create an invisible `<a>` HTML element with download attribute and add the
   above blob to it's `href`.
4. Programmatically click on the `<a>` element so that the browser automatically
   starts downloading and then remove the `<a>` element.

### Download on the server

We use `Node.js` streams to download files on the server, so the steps are as
follows:

1. Create a writable stream for a local file.
2. Make a GET request to `chat_download_url`.
3. Get a readable stream using `res.body` and pipe to the writable stream
   created in the first step.

## Example: CSV chat dump file

This CSV file contains all the chat messages along with the participant's name
and some other metadata. It includes the following column headings:

- `id`: Unique chat message ID
- `participantId`: ID of the participant who sent the message
- `sessionId`: The session ID from which the chat message was sent
- `meetingId`: The ID of the meeting to which this session belongs
- `displayName`: Display name of the participant who sent this message
- `pinned`: A boolean that indicates if the current message was pinned or not
- `isEdited`: A boolean that indicates if the current message was edited or not
- `payloadType`: An ENUM that indicates the type of payload sent in the chat
  message. It can be one of TEXT_MESSAGE, IMAGE_MESSAGE, FILE_MESSAGE
- `payload`: The actual payload sent in the chat message
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when this chat message was sent
