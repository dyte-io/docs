# Meeting Summary

Dyte's meeting summary feature allows you to automatically generate concise summaries of your meeting based on the transcription data.
This feature makes it easy to capture key points and action items, providing a concise overview of your discussions.

:::info
To generate a meeting summary, transcription must be enabled. The summarization feature relies on the transcription data to create accurate and meaningful summaries.

## Enabling Meeting Summarization

To enable automatic summarization post meeting, you can set the `summarize_on_end` flag when creating a meeting using the [REST API](/api#/operations/create_meeting).

### Summarization Configuration Options

You can tailor the summarization process using the following configuration options:

#### Word Limit

Define the word limit for the summary, ensuring it fits your needs. You can set a limit between 150 and 1000 words.

```json lines
"word_limit": 500
```

#### Text Format

Choose the format for the summary text. Supported formats are:

- `plain_text`
- `markdown`

```json lines
"text_format": "markdown"
```

#### Summary Type

Select the type of summary based on the nature of the meeting. Supported types are:

- `general`
- `team_meeting`
- `sales_call`
- `client_check_in`
- `interview`
- `daily_standup`
- `one_on_one_meeting`
- `lecture`
- `code_review`

```json lines
"summary_type": "team_meeting"
```

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how to enable summarization in the meeting creation API call:

```json
{
  "title": "Team Meeting",
  "ai_config": {
    "summarization": {
      "word_limit": 500,
      "text_format": "plain_text",
      "summary_type": "team_meeting"
    }
  },
  "summarize_on_end": true
}
```

## Consuming Summaries

There are two ways to consume the generated summaries:

1. **Webhooks:** Receive the meeting summary via a webhook after the meeting ends.
2. **API Call:** Fetch the meeting summary using the [REST API](/api#/operations/GetMeetingSummary).

### Fetching Summary via Webhook

To receive the meeting summary automatically once the meeting concludes, configure a webhook with the `meeting.summary` event enabled. This can be done either on our [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/webhooks) or using a [REST API](/api#/operations/addWebhook).

You can see the webhook format [here](/guides/capabilities/webhooks/webhook-events#meetingsummary).

### Fetching Summary via API Call

You can use API to fetch the summary for a meeting at a later time using [REST API](/api#/operations/GetSessionSummary)
Dyte stores the summary of a meeting for 7 days since the start of the meeting.

## Triggering Summary manually

If you need to generate a summary after the meeting has ended, you can trigger the summary using [REST API](/api#/operations/post-sessions-session_id-summary).
