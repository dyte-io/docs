# Getting started with Polls

`Poll` objects exist within a meeting and can only be accessed through a meeting object. This object provides methods to create polls, vote, and more.

<Tabs groupId="framework">
<TabItem value="web-components" label="Web Components">

`meeting.polls.items` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where each element is an object of type `Poll` which is defined in the following manner.

The Poll object has the following properties:

`meeting.polls.polls` returns an array of all polls created in a meeting, where
each element is an object of type `DytePollMessage`.

The type `DytePollMessage` is the main class for any poll in Dyte. It also
contains list of `DytePollOption` which are options for a given poll. And every
`DytePollOption` has list of votes inside of it. Votes are objects of class
`DytePollVote` which internally has id and name of the vote.

One can easily create, vote and view polls by listening to callbacks on
`meeting` object.

## Creating a new Poll

### Using the Core SDK

The `Polls` object gives a create function to create a new poll. It accepts the following parameters:

| Param     | Type     | Default Value | Required | Description                                |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| question  | string   | -             | yes      | The question that is to be voted for.      |
| options   | string[] | -             | yes      | The options of the poll.                   |
| anonymous | boolean  | false         | no       | If true, the poll votes are anonymous.     |
| hideVotes | boolean  | false         | no       | If true, the votes on the poll are hidden. |

Check the implementation in your desired framework.

<Tabs groupId="framework">
<TabItem value="web-components" label="Web Components">

```js
await meeting.poll.create(
  'Are you an early bird or a night owl?',
  ['Early bird', 'Night owl'],
  true,
);
```

Here is a snippet of a poll where votes are anonymous.

### Using the REST API

You can also create a poll using the [Create a Poll](/api#/operations/CreatePoll) REST API. This can be used to create a new poll in an active meeting session. In the request, make sure to provide the meeting ID of the session.

To familiarize yourself with the Dyte REST APIs, we recommend exploring the [Dyte REST API Quickstart Guide](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/rest-apis/quickstart).

#### Request

Here is a sample request, make sure to replace the meeting ID and the authorization header with your own.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.io/v2/meetings/meeting_id/active-session/poll \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <api_authorization_token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "question": "string",
  "options": [
    "string"
  ],
  "anonymous": true,
  "hide_votes": true
}'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "action": "string",
    "poll": {
      "id": "string",
      "question": "string",
      "options": [
        {
          "text": "string",
          "count": 0,
          "votes": [
            {
              "id": "string",
              "name": "string"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "anonymous": true,
      "hide_votes": true,
      "created_by": "string",
      "voted": ["string"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Voting on a Poll

The `Poll` object also provides a `vote` method that can be used to register votes on a poll.
It accepts the following parameters:

| Param | Type   | Default Value | Required | Description                                |
| ----- | ------ | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| id    | string | -             | yes      | The ID of the poll that is to be voted on. |
| index | number | -             | yes      | The index of the option.                   |

## View Poll Results

The total votes on a poll can be accessed in the following manner where `votes` is an array of all participant ids.

<Tabs groupId="framework">
<TabItem value="web-components" label="Web Components">

```jsx
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const votes = poll.voted;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react" label="React">

```tsx
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const votes = poll.voted;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flutter" label="Flutter">

```dart
final poll = dyteClient.polls.polls[0];
let votes = 0;
for (final option in poll.options) {
  votes += option.count
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">

```tsx
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const votes = poll.voted;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android" label="Android(Kotlin)">

```kotlin
val poll = meeting.polls.items[0]
val votes = 0;
for (option in poll.options){
  votes += option.votes.siz;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="iOS" label="iOS(Swift)">

```swift
let poll = meeting.polls.items.first
let votes = 0;
for option in poll.options {
  votes += option.votes.count
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To get total votes on a particular poll option, the list of all options can be fetched, through which you can get the number of votes on each option.

<Tabs groupId="framework">
<TabItem value="web-components" label="Web Components">

```jsx
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const options = poll.options;
```

`options` returns an array of objects, where each object is of type [`PollObject`](./).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react" label="React">

```tsx
const poll = meeting.polls.items[0];
const options = poll.options;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flutter" label="Flutter">

```dart
final poll = dyteClient.polls.polls[0];
final options = poll.option;

let options = poll.option;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Get notified when a poll is created or updated

An event is fired each time `items` in the `Polls Objects` are updated or created. User
can listen for this to get the updated list of polls. the response object
contains the following properties.

- `polls`: List of all polls.
- `newPoll`: A boolean variable which is true when a new poll has been created.

<Tabs groupId="framework">
<TabItem value="web-components" label="Web Components">

```ts
meeting.polls.on('pollsUpdate', ({ polls, newPoll }) => {
  console.log(polls, newPoll);
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react" label="React">

```jsx
meeting.polls.on('pollsUpdate', ({ polls, newPoll }) => {
  console.log(polls, newPoll);
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flutter" label="Flutter">

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method onPollUpdates() method from callback `DytePollEventsListener`:

To get poll updates, listen to `onPollUpdates()` callback:

```dart

class PollEventsListeners extends DytePollEventsListener {

  ...

  @override
  void onPollUpdates(List<DytePollMessage> polls) {
    /// code to handle polls
  }

  @override
  void onNewPoll(DytePollMessage poll) {
    /// code to handle new poll
  }

  ...
}

```

You can subscribe to this events by `addPollEventsListener` method:

```dart
dyteClient.addPollEventsListener(PollEventsListeners());
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react-native" label="React Native">

```jsx
meeting.polls.on('pollsUpdate', ({ polls, newPoll }) => {
  console.log(polls, newPoll);
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android" label="Android(Kotlin)">

To be able to receive new poll messages you need to implement a method
`onPollUpdates()` method from callback `DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener`. You can
subscribe to this events by calling
`meeting.addMeetingEventsListener(dyteMeetingRoomEventsListener)`

```kotlin
    meeting.addMeetingRoomEventsListener(object :
      DyteMeetingRoomEventsListener {
      override fun onNewPoll(poll: DytePollMessage) {
        super.onNewPoll(poll)
        // code to handle new poll
      }

      override fun onPollUpdates(pollMessages: List<DytePollMessage>) {
        super.onPollUpdates(pollMessages)
        // code to handle polls and their vote updates.
      }
    })
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="iOS" label="iOS(Swift)">

To receive new poll messages, you must implement the` onPollUpdates()` method from the callback `DytePollEventsListener`. You can subscribe to this event by using the meeting.`addMeetingEventsListener(dytePollEventsListener)` method.

```swift
extension MeetingViewModel: DytePollEventsListener {
      func onNewPoll(poll: DytePollMessage) {
        // code to handle new poll
      }

      func onPollUpdates(pollMessages: [DytePollMessage]) {
        // code to handle polls and their vote updates
      }
    }
```
