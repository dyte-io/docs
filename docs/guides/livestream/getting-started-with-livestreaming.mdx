This topic guides you through the steps of getting started with interactive live streaming for Dyte meetings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the livestreaming process, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the following topics:

- [Voice conferencing](/guides/video-conf/intro-video-conf)
- [Overview of Dyte's Interactive Live Streaming](/guides/livestream/livestream-overview)

## Step 1: Get your API Keys

Login to the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/) and create an account. Copy the [API Keys](https://dev.dyte.io/apikeys) for your organization from the Developer portal. These API Keys are unique to your organization and are required to use Dyte REST APIs such as when instantiating a meeting.

## Step 2: Create Presets

A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to hosts and participants. They determine the look, feel, and behavior of the livestream, with options to set varied permissions, such as the ability to create polls or chat, control access for plugins, and more. For more information on Presets, see [Add Presets](/guides/features/presets).

:::info Note
It is important to understand that you need to create two presets for livestreaming. One preset is used for the livestreaming **host** and the other preset is used for the livestreaming **viewer**.

The host requires certain host controls such as the ability to Kick Participants, Mute Audio, Mute Video, and Pin Participant, as well as media permissions like Start Livestream and Admit or remove participants from the livestream. Ensure that you’ve selected those permissions for the host.

1. In the [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/), click **Presets**, and click **Create New**.

     className="livestrem-create-preset"
   />
2. In the **Select Meeting Type**, select **Livestream**.
3. Set permissions and UI configurations for your livestream.

### Configuration

You can define the following permissions and UI configurations:

**Max number of people on screen**: Set the maximum number of participants who can appear on the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 6 and 9 for the best possible experience.

**Max number of people screensharing**: Set the maximum number of participants who can share the screen at any given time. We recommend setting this number between 3 to 4 for the best experience.

#### Host Controls

Host controls allow you as the host to control various aspects of a Dyte livestream, such as managing the participants.

     width="300"

     className="livestream-save-ilslist"
   />

## Step 4: Create a Meeting

Once you've created a preset for livestreaming, create a Dyte meeting that you want to live stream.

You can create a Dyte meeting using the [Create Meeting API](/api#/operations/create_meeting). This API returns a unique identifier for your meeting. If you wish to start livestreaming the meeting as soon as it starts, set the `live_stream_on_start` parameter `true`.

## Step 5: Add Participants

After you've created the meeting, add participants to the meeting using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant).

The preset created in the [step 2](/guides/livestream/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets) must be passed in the body of the Add Participant API request. Specify the name of the preset in the `preset_name` parameter.

## Step 6: Start Livestreaming a Dyte Meeting

There are two ways to start livestreaming a meeting:

1. Using the API
2. From the meeting UI

### Using API

To start livestreaming a meeting, simply specify the meeting ID in the [Start livestreaming a meeting](/api#/paths/meetings-meeting_id--livestreams/post) API.

For more information, see [Live Stream a Dyte Meeting using API](/guides/livestream/livestream-dyte-meeting).

### From the Meeting UI

If you’ve the host permissions, you will see the option to **Go live** and **End live** streaming.

**Start live streaming**

To start livestreaming a meeting, click on the **Go live** button in the control bar of your meeting.

To stop livestreaming, click on the **End live** button in the control bar.
