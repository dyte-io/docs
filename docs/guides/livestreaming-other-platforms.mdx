# Livestreaming Dyte Meetings to other platforms

Dyte can livestream your meeting to any platform which supports an RTMP endpoint
like YouTube, Twitch etc. All you need to do is pass that RTMP endpoint while
you [start the recording](/api/#/operations/start_recording).

For example, if you want to stream it to [restream.io](https://restream.io), you
can do:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY yourapi-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"liveStreamingConfig": {
  		"rtmpUrl": "rtmp://live.restream.io/live/your-stream-key"
  	}
}'
```

And it just works ðŸ™Œ

### Considerations

1. Currently, you need to [start a recording](/api/#/operations/start_recording)
   to live stream your content.
2. There is few seconds of lag between the meeting and the stream.
