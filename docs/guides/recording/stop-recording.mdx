Dyte recordings can be stopped in any of the following ways:

1. **Automatic Stop (Empty meeting)**: A Dyte recording will automatically stop
   if the meeting has no participants for a duration of 1 minute or more. This
   wait time can be customized by contacting Dyte’s support team to configure a
   custom value for your organization.
2. **Automatic Stop (maxSeconds elapsed)**: A recording will automatically stop
   regardless of if there are participants or not in the meeting if the
   recording has been going on for a duration more than the `max_seconds`
   parameter passed to the recording while starting it. If this parameter is not
   passed, it has a default value of 24 hours (86400 seconds).
3. **Using Stop Recording API**: A recording can also be stopped by passing the
   recording ID to our [Stop Recording](/api/?v=v2#/operations/stop_recording)
   APIs.

When a recording is stopped, it transitions to the `UPLOADING` state and then to the `UPLOADED` state after it has been transferred to Dyte's storage and any external storage that has been set up.
