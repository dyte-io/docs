# Controlling an Active Session

An active session (ongoing meeting) can be controlled programatically using
[Active Session APIs](/api/v2/#/operations/GetActiveSession). For now, you can
do following things in an Active Session.

- Fetch active session details.
- Kick one or more participants.
- Kick all participants.
- Mute one or more participants.
- Mute all participants.
- Create a poll.

## Get Active Session details

You can get an active session of a meeting using `meetingId`. Refer to
[`GET` active session endpoint](/api/v2/#/operations/GetActiveSession) under
[v2 API Reference](/api/v2/#/).

## Kick one or more participants

You can kick one or multiple participants from an active session using
`participant_ids` or `custom_participant_ids`.

> `custom_participant_id` is called `clientSpecificId` in v1 and it's the same
> id that you pass in body of

## Mute one or more participants

request body and response.

## Mute all participants

specify if participants can unmute themselves or not using `allow_unmute` option
in request body. Refer to

details.

## Create a poll

You can also create a poll in an active session programatically. Poll will
always be created under your organization's name. You can specify different
options while creating poll like `hide_votes`, `anonymous` etc. Refer to
[Create Poll endpoint](/api/v2/#/operations/CreatePoll) to see complete details.
