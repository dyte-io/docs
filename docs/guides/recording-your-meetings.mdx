# Recording your meetings via Dyte

We allows recordings for all Dyte meetings. This feature records the grid part
of the meeting. The result of the recording is an mp4 file, encoded using
`H.264` codec (this can be changed).

Usually to record a meeting, the flow of APIs is like below:

1. Start a recording by using the
   [`POST` endpoint](/api/#/operations/start_recording).
2. Poll the [`GET` endpoint](/api/#/operations/get_recording) to check the
   status of recording.
3. Stop the recording by using the
   [`PUT` endpoint](/api/#/operations/stop_recording).
4. Use the [`GET` endpoint](/api/#/operations/get_recording) again to get a
   pre-signed URL for downloading the recording.

You can also use
[webhooks as described here](./integrating-with-webhooks#recordingstatusupdate)
to subscribe to meeting status update events instead of polling.

## Recording states

Recording can have one of these states, which are also notified through
[webhooks](./integrating-with-webhooks#recordingstatusupdate):

| Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| INVOKED   | The recording function has been invoked and will start recording the meeting very shortly.                                                                                 |
| RECORDING | The meeting is currently being recorded.                                                                                                                                   |
| UPLOADING | The recording has been stopped and the file is being uploaded to cloud storage. The storage would be Dyte's if no storage parameters are passed in the recording API call. |
| UPLOADED  | The recording file upload is complete.                                                                                                                                     |
| ERRORED   | There was an error while recording the meeting and the file wouldn't be available.                                                                                         |

## Considerations for a recording

1. Recording will stop if there is no participant in the meeting for 60 seconds
   (1 minute).
2. There can only be one active recording of a meeting.
3. Average size for one hour of recording is approximately `300MB`.
4. Maximum recording time is 24 hours. Recording will automatically stop after
   the expiry of that period from the time of recording start. This option can
   be configured by passing the `maxSeconds` parameter in the start recording
   API.

## Recording settings

You can modify the codec which is used for recording the videos. We currently
support three codecs

1. H264 (default):
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/h264_sample.webm)
2. VP8:
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/vp8_sample.webm)
3. VP9:
   [sample recording](https://dyte-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/test/vp9_sample.webm)

:::caution Resolution

By default, Dyte uses a resolution of 720p for all recordings. If there is a
requirement for a higher resolution, please contact us directly to configure the
same for your organization.

:::

You can change the codec by specifying the codec in `videoConfig` when you are
creating a recording.

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY yourapi-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"videoConfig": {
		"codec": "VP8"
	}
}'
```

## Publishing a recording to your cloud provider

You can pass an optional object `storageConfig` in the start recording request
and we will publish the recording directly to your cloud provider once it stops.
If a `path` is specified, the recorded video will be stored there, otherwise the
default is the root of the directory. The filename for recording will be the
same as given in `outputFileName` in the [start recording](ref:startrecording)
response.

:::caution Limited access keys

Please make sure that the cloud keys you provide to Dyte APIs have only limited
access.

:::

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.dyte.in/v1/organizations/orgid/meetings/meetingid/recording \
  --header 'Authorization: APIKEY your-api-key' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	    "storageConfig": {
                "type": "aws",
                "accessKey": "aws_access_key",
                "secret": "aws_secret",
                "bucket": "bucket_name",
                "region": "aws_region"
