This topic covers essential concepts related to Dyte Live Video applications.

## Developer portal

The [Developer Portal](https://dev.dyte.io/dashboard) serves as a comprehensive platform, offering access to meeting logs, API key management, billing operations, and various other functionalities in one place.

You can also use Developer Portal to create meetings, presets, setup storage for recordings, add webhooks, and much more.

## Organization

In Dyte, the organization serves as the top-level entity where all participants of your group are added. You can create an organization using the [API](/api#/operations/createOrg) or through the Developer Portal.

- Meetings are created within the organization.
- The API keys are generated for your organization. These API Keys are unique to your organization and are required to use Dyte REST APIs such as when instantiating a meeting.
- Additionally, Dyte considers the organization as a billing unit.

## Meeting

A communication channel created on Dyte is termed as a `meeting`. Meetings can be created using the [Create a meeting API](/api#/operations/create_meeting) or through the Developer Portal. Similarly, you can get the details of your meeting using the [API](/api#/operations/get_all_meetings) or developer portal.

An example from the Developer Portal displaying meeting details.

## Session

In Dyte, a meeting is a communication channel, and each instance of that channel is called a session. A session represents an ongoing meeting within that communication channel. Like meetings, you can get fetch the details of a session via Developer Portal or using the [APIs](/api#/operations/GetSessions).

## Preset

A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that are applied to participants for different meeting types such as Group Call, Webinar, and Livestream. The presets define how a meeting will appear visually and functional aspects of the meeting. They allow customization options like setting maximum number of participants on-screen, permissions to share screen, enabling poll creation, disabling video and audio, adjusting text color, configuring plugins, etc.

For more information, see [Add Presets](/guides/integrate-core-features/add-presets).

## Participants

Anyone who joins the `meeting`, including actual users and machine users. You can add participants using the [Add Participant API](/api#/operations/add_participant). Participants will have permissions for the meeting depending on the selected preset. The `presetName` must be passed in the body of the Add Participant API request.

## Meeting ID

The meeting ID is a unique identifier assigned to your meeting, obtained through the [Create a Meeting](/api#/operations/create_meeting) API or from the Developer Portal. This ID is used for various actions, including adding or deleting participants, initiating or stopping meeting recording, starting or ending live streaming, and more.

## Session ID

Session ID is a unique identifier assigned to your meeting, obtained through the [Fetch all sessions of an organization](/api#/operations/GetSessions). This API returns the the session ID along with the associated meeting ID. You can also get the Session IDs and its detail from the Developer Portal.
