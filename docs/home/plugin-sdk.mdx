# Plugin SDK

Plugins allow you to host interactive, collaborative, and effective meetings.
You can use plugins like Remote Browser, YouTube, Miro, Excalidraw, and many
more to collaborate when having a Dyte meeting.

Plugins SDK allows developers to build, test and deploy Plugins. Currently, this
SDK is under Beta Testing. Please fill out this form if you would like to try
out our Plugins SDK and build Plugins for Dyte.
