  A short guide on how to integrate dyte and how dyte works with your
  application

# Getting Started With Dyte

Dyte offers solutions for integrating high-quality video/voice calls into your
web, mobile, and desktop applications.

This topic introduces you to the components of Dyte and gives a quick
walkthrough of the steps involved in integrating high-quality real-time
communication features into your app using Dyte.

### Components of Dyte

- **Backend HTTP REST APIs**: Your backend uses Dyte REST APIs to perform
  actions such as, create meetings, add participants to a meeting etc
- **Frontend SDKs**: Your applications bundle Dyte Core SDKs (and UI Kits) to
  acquire, transmit and play media, and manage network connections.
- **Developer Portal**: Your one-stop shop for all meeting logs, API keys,
  billing and more

### Integrate Dyte

1. To get started with Dyte, you must first register in the
   [Developer portal](https://dev.dyte.io)

2. Copy the [API Keys](https://dev.dyte.io/apikeys) for your organization from
   the Developer portal. These API Keys are unique to your organization and are
   required to use Dyte REST APIs such as when instantiating a meeting

3. [Create presets](https://dev.dyte.io/roles-presets) using the Developer
   portal. A preset is a set of permissions and UI configurations that would be
   applied to a participant

4. Create a Dyte meeting using the
   [Create Meeting API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/create_meeting).

   This API returns you an unique identifier for your meeting `roomName`<br/>
   Note: You may need to persist this in your database.

5. After you've created the meeting, add each participant to the meeting using
   the
   [Add Participant API](https://docs.dyte.io/api#/operations/add_participant)
   (The `presetName` created earlier must be passed in the body of the Add
   Participant API request)

   The API response contains the user authentication token `authToken`.

6. Use the `roomName` and `authToken` to initialize any of the frontend SDKs.

Dyte meetings do not have a date or time associated with them, so you can create
them ahead of time in advance or when users need to join the meeting. The idea
is that your backend controls when to distribute 'roomName' and 'authToken,' and
thus you can share the tokens with the users only at the scheduled time.
